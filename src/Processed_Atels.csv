0,ATEL #12339,"We report spectroscopic observations of AT2018lab, discovered by the DLT40 survey on UT 2018 Dec 29.13 in the luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) IC 2163. The observations were performed using the FLOYDS spectrograph on Faulkes-South on UT 2018 Dec 29.46. The spectrum reveals a mostly featureless blue continuum. We also note the presence of H-alpha emission in our spectrum with FWHM of 400 km/s. This feature could be associated with the host galaxy IC 2163, but is blueshifted from the nominal recessional velocity of the host by 600 km/s."
1,ATEL #12340,"On 2018 December 21, MAXI/GSC detected a bright hard X-ray transient source, MAXI J1631-479, in the Norma region (Kobayashi et al., ATEL#12320). The X-ray pulsar AX J1631.9-4752/IGR J16320-4751 is within the MAXI error circle and was suggested to be the source producing the bright transient emission. However, the Swift/BAT position reported for the bright source (GCN#23550) is 8.4 arcminutes away from the XMM position of AX J1631.9-4752. As this is significantly more than the 3 arcminute uncertainty (90% confidence) in the Swift/BAT position, we obtained two NuSTAR observations on December 28: a 14 ks observation pointed at the Swift/BAT position and a 12 ks observation pointed at AX J1631.9-4752. In the 14 ks NuSTAR observation, we found a very bright source at R.A. = 247.806 deg, Decl. = -47.805 deg (J2000) with an uncertainty of 15 arcsec. This position is consistent with the Swift/BAT position and is not consistent with the position of AX J1631.9-4752. In addition, a search of the SIMBAD database does not show any known source consistent with the NuSTAR position. Thus, we conclude that MAXI J1631-479 is a new X-ray transient. The NuSTAR observations were performed when the source was 34 degrees away from the sun. As the sun is close to the FOV, the star tracker used for aspect reconstruction was only available approximately for 2.6 ks, but we were able to obtain the source position with NuSTAR nominal astrometric accuracy due to the brightness of the source. The source is detected across the 3-79 keV NuSTAR bandpass with a count rate in excess of 600 c/s (FPMA and FPMB combined). An absorbed disk-blackbody plus power-law model provides a reasonably good description of the continuum with a reduced chi2 of 1.25 for 893 degrees of freedom. The column density is (2.9+/-0.2)e22 atoms/cm2 (using wilm abundances), the temperature of the disk-blackbody is 1.12+/-0.01 keV, and the power-law photon index is 2.39+/-0.02 (90% confidence errors). The 3-79 keV and 2-10 keV absorbed fluxes are 1.8e-8 erg/cm2/s and 1.7e-8 erg/cm2/s, respectively. The residuals show clear evidence for an iron Kalpha emission line, and adding a broad gaussian with an equivalent width of 90 eV improves the fit significantly. This demonstrates that we are seeing a reflection component in the spectrum. The spectral properties of MAXI J1631-479 indicate that it is very likely to be an accreting black hole in the soft state. In the future, further work on the MAXI and Swift/BAT data may provide more information about the overall evolution of the current outburst. The source is still in outburst, and multi-wavelength observations are encouraged. Based on the behavior of other black hole transients, the outburst may last for another month or more."

Molonglo is a 1.6 km long East-West array (Bailes et al 2017, PASA, 34, 45) and was operating in drift-scan mode with pointing centred on the meridian at the time of detection. Source localisation is excellent in Right Ascension (5 arcsec at 1-sigma) but poor in Declination (~1.2 deg at 1-sigma) (see Caleb et al 2017 MNRAS 468, 3746). FRB181228 was found during a blind FRB search programme in real-time using an automated GPU-accelerated/machine learning based pipeline and the raw voltages were recorded for offline processing. The optimal dispersion measure (DM) that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio is: 354 pc cm^-3 . The DM estimate of NE2001 model is ~58 pc cm^-3, and YMW16 model is ~61 pc cm^-3 at this position, resulting in an intergalactic excess of ~290 pc cm^-3. The upper limit on the DM-inferred redshift is thus z ~ 0.26 . An early estimate (lower limit) of the apparent fluence of the event is ~ 18 Jy ms (corrected for attenuation of the primary beam in the RA direction, but not in the Dec direction), width ~ 2.19 ms, with a detection signal-to-noise ratio = 12.

Preliminary analysis indicates that on December 25, 2018 the source was in a high state with a gamma-ray daily averaged flux (E>100MeV) of (0.4 +/- 0.1) x10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1 (uncertainty is statistical only), and a single power-law photon index of 2.5 +/- 0.3. It was also detected on December 14, 2018 with the same flux of (0.4 +/- 0.1) x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1, but with a harder spectrum (photon index = 1.8 +/- 0.2). The source was initially reported as a low-significance LAT source in the LMC field (Abdo et al. 2010 A&A 512, 7). Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring of this source will continue. In consideration of the activity of this source we strongly encourage multiwavelength observations. The Fermi LAT contact person for this source is B. Rani (bindu.rani at nasa.gov).

The R-band brightness calibrated through the USNOB1.0 catalog is 17.1mag, which is brighter than the GROND followup observations taken at 8 hours before (Chen et al. ATel#12329). The low resolution spectrum of ATLAS18bcde (AT2018kpo) has been obtained by the NAOC Xinglong 2.16m telescope with the BEFOSC spectragraph at 2018-12-25T12:08. The spectrum taken by an exposure of 1800s shows the transient has a quite blue featureless spectrum. after correcting for the Milky Way extinction by E(B-V)=0.05mag (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011)."
15,ATEL #12325,"ASASSN-18ro (a.k.a., SN 2018evt, RA: 13:46:39.21 Dec: -09:38:35.75 ) was discovered by All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN; Shappee et al. 2014; Atel #11963) on UT 2018-08-11.00 at V ~ 16.5 mag (absolute magnitude M_V ~ -18.8 mag) in the host galaxy MCG -01-35-011 (z = 0.024971; A_V = 0.15 mag for Galactic extinction via NED). It was classified by ePESSTO as a SN Ia (best match SN Ia 1991T-like; Atel #11947). Recent ASAS-SN observations of ASASSN-18ro show that it is at g ~ 16.4 mag on UT 2018-12-16.36 and g ~ 16.6 mag on 2018-12-22.09. Therefore, after 4 months of its discovery, the luminosity of ASASSN-18ro is still at about -19 mag, and such a high late-time luminosity is not compatible with the light curve of a typical (1991T-like) SN Ia. We note that ZTF and Gaia also recently detect ASASSN-18ro at a similar brightness, i.e. r = 16.24 +/- 0.02 mag on UT 2018-12-16.54 from ZTF (available via Lasair:  ) and G = 16.32 mag on UT 2018-12-17.18 from Gaia Transient Alerts ( ). Re-inspection of the ePESSTO spectrum (taken with the ESO-NTT / EFOSC2-NTT at UT 2018-08-12.9995; available via TNS:  ) shows a prominent H-alpha emission line with FWHM ~ 1000 km/s (EW ~ 22 Angstrom). The archival 6dF spectrum (available via NED) at the nucleus of the host galaxy does not show any H-alpha emission. The H-alpha emission line likely origins from CSM interactions, which may also explain the high late-time luminosity of ASASSN-18ro. We note that some 1991T-like SNe Ia have been shown to have evidence of CSM interactions (e.g., Harris et al., 2018, ApJ, 868, 21; Graham et al., 2018, arXiv:1812.02757 and references therein).

17,ATEL #12327,"The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, has observed the brightest ever gamma-ray flare from a source positionally consistent with the flat spectrum radio quasar TXS 0646-176 also known as 3FGL J0648.8-1740 (Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23). Its coordinates are R.A. = 102.1187437 deg, Decl. = -17.7348444 deg (J2000; Petrov et al. 2006, AJ, 131, 1872), and it has a redshift z=1.232 (Hewitt & Burbidge 1993, ApJS, 87, 451). Preliminary analysis indicates that on December 22, TXS 0646-176 reached a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV) of (3.6+/-0.6)X10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (uncertainty is statistical only). This corresponds to a flux increase of a factor of about 170 relative to the average flux reported in the third Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL). This is the highest LAT daily flux ever observed for this source, nearly two and a half times greater than observed during a previous flaring episode in Nov 2018 (ATel #12252). It has a corresponding photon index (E>100 MeV) of 2.4+/-0.2 which is consistent with the 3FGL value of 2.5+\-0.1. Previous flaring activity has been reported by Fermi LAT in June 2018 (ATel#11706) and July 2015 (ATel#7833). An optical flare was observed in this source on Nov 12 (ATel#12293). Because Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring of this source will continue. A preliminary estimation of the daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi-LAT will be publicly available ( ). In consideration of the ongoing activity of this source, we encourage multiwavelength observations. For this source the Fermi LAT contact person is S. Ciprini (stefano.ciprini@ssdc.asi.it). The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.

18,ATEL #12328,"We report optical photometry of the flat spectrum radio quasar J1153-1105, obtained with the 2.56m Nordic Optical Telescope in La Palma, to look for any enhanced optical activity associated with a recent flare in the daily averaged gamma-ray flux seen in Fermi J1153-1124 (ATel#12206, ATel#12208). These NOT observations were made using the ALFOSC (Alhambra Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera) instrument at the epoch 2018-12-09T07:04. Standard IRAF data reduction (de-biasing + flat field correction with twilight flats) was carried out and differential photometry was performed. The brightness was calibrated against 17 SDSS field stars near the target. The std-dev of the zero point was 0.03 mag. We find that PKS J1153-1105 had an SDSS r-magnitude = 18.82 +- 0.03 (AB-system). This result suggests that there is significant enhancement in its optical magnitude. An historic value of this object's r-magnitude from PanSTARRS at mean epoch 2013-02-24 is 19.3 (Chambers et al. 2016, arXiv:1612.05560). This brightening supports the identification of Fermi J1153-1124 with PKS J1153-1105. We encourage further multi-wavelength coverage. We will continue to monitor this source and report future developments using this and other platforms."
19,ATEL #12323,"The magnetar XTE J1810-197 has experienced periods of activity in X-rays (Ibrahim et al. 2004) and in radio frequencies, being the first magnetar in which radio pulsations were detected (Camilo et al. 2006). After being in a radio-quiet state for several years (Camilo et al. 2016), this magnetar has recently re-entered in outburst (ATEL #12284, #12285). The IAR (Argentinian Institute of Radioastronomy,   ) is going through major upgrades to suit its two 30-m antennas for pulsar timing investigations performed by the PuMA (Pulsar Monitoring in Argentina   ) collaboration. As an exploratory study, we dedicated observing time to the transient XTE J1810-197 during December 14 (MJD 58466.615), December 19 (MJD 58471.614) and December 20 (MJD 58472.615). Single-polarization observations with a bandwidth of 56 MHz centered at 1420 MHz revealed significant pulsating radio emission from XTE J1810-197 with a barycentric spin-period of P = 5.54137(3) s on MJD 58466.615, consistent with the values reported in ATEL #12284, and #12312. In subsequent observations we obtained signal-to-noise ratios of 16 for a 90-min observation (Antenna 2, Dec. 14), 24 for 150-min observation (Antenna 1, Dec. 19), 10 for a 80-min observation (Antenna 2, Dec. 19) on the first polarization and 14 on the second polarization, and 15 for a 50-min observation (Antenna 2, Dec. 20). Unfortunately, we could not derive polarization angles and calibrated fluxes with these measurements. The pulse profiles from Dec. 14 showed a complex structure of a short, strong peak preluded by a less intense and longer in duration precursor (<a href="" ""> Dec. 14 pulse profile at 1400 MHz</a>), as reported at other frequencies in ATEL #12284, #12285, and #12312.

Assuming that the source flux was constant over each scan transit at 04:33 and 06:06, we obtain the source position at (R.A., Dec) = (247.770 deg, -47.920 deg) = (16 31 04, -47 55 12) (J2000) with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short radii of 0.17 deg and 0.17 deg, respectively. The roll angle of the long axis from the north direction is 18.0 deg counterclockwise. There is an additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment radius). The X-ray flux averaged over the scans was 209 +- 27 mCrab (4.0-10.0keV, 1 sigma error). The error region includes the 1309 second X-ray pulsar AX J1631.9-4752/IGR J16320-4751 (Sugizaki et al. 2001, ApJS, 134, 77; Rodriguez et al. 2003, A&A, 407, L41l; Lutovinov et al. 2005, A&A 433, L41). In previous observations, AX J1631.9-4752 showed hard energy spectra (e.g., Rodriguez et al. 2006, A&A, 366, 274), but the fluxes were below several tens of mCrab. The first trigger with the alert system was at 18:25 on December 18, 2018. At that time, however, the source was near the edge of a detector and it was difficult to identify the source. The source went into an invisible sky area soon after that, and entered the field of view again on December 21. An interpolated light curve suggests that the source flux has been increasing since the first detection. On the other hand, the Swift/BAT light curve of AX J1631.9-4752 ( ) showed flare-like behavior on December 21. Because of the brightest outburst never seen before from AX J1631.9-4752, and relatively poor spatial resolution of MAXI/GSC, we tentatively name the source MAXI J1631-479.

25,ATEL #12322,"We report on new X-ray observations of the black hole binary system GX 339-4. GX 339-4 is a prototypical black hole binary with recurring outbursts every 2-3 years. A significant increase in the radio luminosity has been recently reported (Tremou et al. 2018, Atel #12287) indicating a new outburst has started. While monitoring is currently not attainable with most X-ray instruments due to Sun constrain, observations are possible using the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR; Harrison et al. 2013, ApJ, 770, 103). Thus, with requested Directors Discretionary Time (DDT), we have triggered a single ~17.5 ks NuSTAR observation of GX 339-4. The observation was performed when the source was roughly 25 degrees away from the Sun. This reduces the overall astrometric accuracy of NuSTAR as the star tracker used to reconstruct the source on the sky was blinded by the Sun. We used a relatively large (100"") extraction region centered on the apparent position of the source to account for the jitter in the source location. High level science products (lightcurves, spectra, and response files) are minimally affected when operating in this mode as long as the source is bright. The source is detected at ~6 counts per second by both Focal Plane Modules A and B (FPMA/FPMB), well above the background signal in the entire NuSTAR band (3-79 keV). We measure the source flux at ~2.4e-11 erg/cm^2/s (2-10 keV). The spectra were fitted with an absorbed power-law model (TBabs*pow) with a fixed hydrogen column density of N_H = 5.e21 cm^-2. We observe a hard power-law continuum with Gamma = 1.55 +/- 0.01. Clear signatures of X-ray reprocessing (reflection) are observed in the form of Fe K emission, Fe K edge, and possibly an excess above ~20 keV due to electron scattering in the reflection (Compton hump). By fitting the Fe K emission with a Gaussian profile with fixed width (sigma=0.01 keV), we measure the centroid energy at E = 6.39 +\- 0.06 keV, and an equivalent width of ~57 eV. The hard continuum, flux level, and presence of reflection features are consistent with the beginning of a new outburst, and show remarkable resemblance with the last (failed) outburst of this source observed in October 2017-January 2018 (Garcia et al. 2017, Atel #10825), as well as with previous NuSTAR and Suzaku measurements at similar luminosities (Wang-Ji et al. 2018, ApJ 855, 61, Tomsick et al. 2009, ApJL, 707, 87). Given that observations with other X-ray telescopes will not be possible until middle January 2019, additional NuSTAR DDT observations will be requested in order to monitor the evolution of this source until the Sun exclusion period is over. We thank the NuSTAR SOC team for the prompt scheduling of this observation."

Walter (ATel #12295). We obtained two spectra of this object under the SALT Large Science Program on transients on 2018 December 12.9 and 14.9 UT, using the High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS; Crause et al. 2014, Proc. SPIE, 91476) mounted on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). Observations were taken in the LR mode of HRS, covering a spectral range of 3800-8900 A at a resolution of R = 14000. The data were reduced with the SALT HRS MIDAS pipeline (Kniazev et al. 2016, MNRAS 459, 3068). The spectra show a blue continuum with relatively strong Halpha, Hbeta, and relatively weak He I and He II lines in emission (see below a list of the line identifications). The emission lines are characterised by double emission peaks (separated by ~ 135 km/s for Hbeta and ~ 100 km/s for Halpha) and a heliocentric corrected Vr ~ -15 +/- 5 km/s (for the line centre). We measure a FWZI ~ 450 +/- 20 km/s for Hbeta and ~ 420 km/s for Halpha. The emission feature of Hbeta is superimposed on a relatively broad absorption feature (FWZI ~ 2000 +/- 200 km/s). The weak emission features of He I (4471, 4922, and 5016 A) are also superimposed on a broad emission feature. In addition broad absorption features of Hgamma and Hdelta are also present. Overall, the spectrum is typical for a dwarf nova in outburst. The EW of the Na I D interstellar absorption doublet is consistent with low extinction towards the source (Av ~ 0.06), which is considerably lower than the total reddening value (Av~ 2.6) in this direction from the Galactic reddening maps by Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011, ApJ, 737, 103). This indicates that the dwarf nova is nearby, in agreement with the high optical and UV brightness of the outburst and negligible X-ray extinction (ATel #12294). Emission line identifications: H I (Balmer): 4861 and 6563 A He I: 4471, 4922, 5016, 5876, 6678, and 7065 A He II: 4686 A"
28,ATEL #12312,"Magnetar Intense radio emission from the magnetar XTE J1810-197 (Gotthelf et al. 2003, Ibrahim et al. 2004) has recently been reported in monitoring observations with the Lovell radio telescope (Lyne et al. 2018, ATEL #12284). These observations have been at higher frequencies and subsequent follow-up have detected pulsation at frequencies above 835 MHz (Lyne et al. 2018, ATEL #12284; Desvignes et al. 2018, ATEL #12285; Lower et al. 2018, ATEL #12288). Although the source is near Sun, enhanced high energy emission is also indicated in follow up observations (Mihara et al. 2018, ATel #12291; Gotthelf et al. 2018, ATEL #12297). This is only second such outburst accompanied by radio emission from this unique magnetar in last 10 years, during which the source was in quiescence state (Camilo et al. 2006; Camilo et al. 2016) We observed this source for about 40 minutes with the upgraded GMRT (Gupta et al. 2018) using a phased array of 19 antennas at Band 4 between 550-750 MHz. We recorded the data with 4096 channels across 200 MHz bandwidth with a sampling time of 1.3 ms. Intense single pulses were detected with 35 to 70 signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Our best estimate of the period and DM are 5.54156(7) s and 181(5) respectively. The average profile with very high S/N of about 700 shows two distinct components with a large and narrow trailing component following a smaller and wider leading component. The emission was seen across the whole band from 550 to 750 MHz. The profile evolves across the band with the ratio of peak of trailing component to leading component varying from 2.7 to 3 from 550 to 750 MHz. Our preliminary estimate of the source flux density averaged over the full bandwidth is 17(7) mJy. We also notice a significant evolution of the flux density across the observed bandwidth.

30,ATEL #12314,"We report on new Swift observations of the nearby Seyfert 1.5 galaxy NGC 1566 which indicate a rebrightening of the AGN in X-rays and the UV. NGC 1566 was discovered in a hard X-ray outburst in June 2018 by INTEGRAL (Ducci et al., ATel #11754) and Swift follow-up observation showed dramatic increases in its soft X-ray and UV fluxes as well (Ferrigno et al., ATel #11783; Kuin et al., ATel #11786; Grupe et al., ATel #11903). We continued monitoring NGC 1566 and it faded over the following months, reaching a low point by the end of October. It has steadily become brighter again and in our most recent Swift observation from 2018-December-18 it had an 0.3-10 keV flux (5.77+/-0.15)e-14 W/m^2 which corresponds to a count rate of 1.87+/-0.05 counts/s in the Swift XRT. This is a factor of about 3 higher than in October. In the UVOT all 6 filters were used and we found the following (corrected/uncorrected for Galactic reddening) Vega magnitudes: V = 13.74/13.74, B = 14.42/14.45, U = 13.52/13.56, UVW1 = 13.65/13.70, UVM2 = 13.65/13.72, UVW2 = 13.84/13.90. All magnitudes were determined with a 3"" source extraction radius to avoid significant contribution by starlight and have an uncertainty of 0.05 magnitudes. Since the end of October, NGC 1566 has become brighter by about 0.6 magnitudes in the UV filters. We would like to thank Brad Cenko for approving our various ToO requests and the Swift team for executing our observations. We continue monitoring this AGN with Swift."

Earlier 0.47-2.5 micron spectroscopy was obtained on 2018 Oct 20 using the Aerospace Corporation’s Visible and Near-Infrared Imaging Spectrograph on the 3-m Shane reflector at the University of California’s Lick Observatory. The nova’s infrared spectral energy distribution is dominated by a strong thermal continuum from dust, which exhibits a peak flux of approximately 2 Jy near 5 microns and is well matched by a blackbody of temperature 770 K. A less certain temperature derived from the October near-infrared data is 720 K, indicating that the dust has not cooled and has possibly warmed in the interval. An additional broad emission bump is detected near 8.1 microns, which resembles unidentified infrared (UIR) features previously observed in Nova Cassiopeiae 1993 (aka V705 Cas; Evans et al. 2005, MNRAS, 360, 1483) and V2362 Cyg (Lynch et al. 2008, AJ, 136, 1815). The near-infrared spectrum of the atomic emission lines increased in excitation between the October and December observations. He II and Rydberg lines were present in the former while in the latter, coronal lines, most notably [Si VI] at 1.9645 microns, have emerged. Continued monitoring of this infrared-bright nova is encouraged."

Preliminary analysis indicates that on December 19, 2018 the source was in a high state with a gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (0.5 +/- 0.2) x10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1, which represents a factor of 5 increase with respect to the last reported LAT detection of this source in 2013 (Atel# 5668). The single power-law photon index for this source was 2.2 +/- 0.2. The source was also detected between December 14-16, 2018 with fluxes (0.4 -- 0.5) x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1. The gamma-ray source was previously named Fermi J0623-3351, and subsequently reported as the Fermi-LAT catalog source, 2FAV J0623-33.7 (Abdollahi et al. 2017 ApJ 846, 34). Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring of this source will continue. In consideration of the activity of this source we strongly encourage multiwavelength observations. The Fermi LAT contact person for this source is S. Buson (sara.buson at gmail.com).

45,ATEL #12295,"The optical transient ASASSN-18abj was reported by R. Fidrich in vsnet-alert 22827. On the basis of the large amplitude outburst, Fidrich suggested it could be a galactic nova or a nearby CV. R. Hinojosa and L. Paredes obtained a spectrum with the SMARTS Chiron fiber-fed high resolution spectrograph at 0527UT on 2018 Dec 14. The integration time was 10 minutes; the resolution is 27,800. The spectrum shown a blue continuum. H&alpha; is in emission above the continuum with an equivalent width of -3.6&#197; and a full width at zero intensity of 9.7&#197;. The central velocity of the line is -12 km/s. The line has a narrow central reversal with a depth of 20% of the emission line intensity. The H&beta; line has a centrally-reversed emission reversal (equivalent width -0.5&#197;); the absorption line FWZI is about 27&#197;. H&gamma; and H&delta; are in absorption.

47,ATEL #12297,"Based on reports of renewed radio activity from XTE J1810-197 (ATel #12284, #12285, #12288), we initiated a NuSTAR Director's Discretionary Time observation of the magnetar from UT 2018 Dec 13 03:59:08 to Dec 13 23:49:24 resulting in 21.9 ks of usable data. A bright source was detected with a steady count rate of 4.8 counts/s with flux up to at least 30 keV in the hard (3-79 keV) NuSTAR bandpass. The source location is consistent with XTE J1810-197, given the large coordinate uncertainty (~2') associated with a NuSTAR observation close (10 degrees) to the Sun. The high count rate is also consistent with the X-ray flux enhancement for XTE J1810-197 observed by MAXI/GSC (ATel #12291). A preliminary analysis reveals that the spectrum is similar to that found during the discovery outburst of 2003 (Ibrahim et al. 2004, ApJ, 609, L21), with a blackbody temperature of kT = 0.73+/-0.01 keV and a non-thermal power-law tail with a steep photon index of 4.28+/-0.11. The absorption column, characterized by the TBABS model in XSPEC, is not well-constrained in the NuSTAR bandpass and is held fixed in the fit to NH = 1.0E22 cm^-2. The absorbed 2-10 keV flux is 2.0E-10 erg/s/cm^2, a factor of 2 greater than the 2003 projected maximum outburst flux of (0.8-1.1)E-10 erg/s/cm^2, determined by fitting an exponential decay model to the historic light curve (Gotthelf & Halpern 2007, Ap&SS, 308, 79). A strong pulsed signal is recovered at a barycentric period of 5.5414468(43) s at MJD 58465.2, where the uncertainty on the least significant digits, given in parentheses, is computed from delta Z^2_1 = -1 from the peak period in the Z^2_1 periodogram. The pulse profile is close to a pure sine curve with a pulsed fraction of ~29%, similar in shape to that recorded by XMM-Newton during the previous outburst, but less modulated. There is no evidence for bursts on second timescales, as detected by RXTE during the earlier outburst (Woods et. al. 2005, 629, 985); however the chance of catching a burst during the short NuSTAR observation is low."

51,ATEL #12292,"The transient AT 2018fdx (ASASSN-18sk; ATel 11964, 11967) was detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) during observations of Sector 1. Preliminary photometry was extracted using a 9-pixel aperture with the transient well separated from the brighter stars in the field. With a 30-minute cadence, the photometry reveals a complex light curve consistent with a dwarf nova (DN) outburst. The transient is first detected on BJD2458345.1 and reaches an initial peak 1.1 days later. The star then fades by 1.7 mag over 4 days before rising again to a second, brighter maximum on BJD2458351.5. Rapid variability is seen beginning near the time of the second maximum. Observations of Sector 1 ended 1.6 days after the time of the second peak. The initial peak is consistent with a normal DN outburst which has nearly faded away before a superoutburst begins. The rapid variability around the second peak is likely due to superhump oscillations and we conclude that AT2018fdx is an SU UMa type DN. A power spectrum of the oscillations over the first 3 days of the superoutburst gives a superhump period of 2.10 hours. A light curve phased on that period shows that the superhumps have a total amplitude of 0.3 mag."
52,ATEL #12293,"We report optical photometry of the QSO TXS 0646-176, obtained with the 2.56m Nordic Optical Telescope in La Palma, to look for any enhanced optical activity associated with a recent flare in the daily averaged gamma-ray flux (ATel#12252). These NOT observations were made using the ALFOSC (Alhambra Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera) instrument at the epoch 2018-12-09T01:24. Standard IRAF data reduction (de-biasing + flat field correction with twilight flats) was carried out and differential photometry was performed. The brightness was calibrated against 54 SDSS field stars near the target. The std-dev of the zero point was 0.04 mag. We find that TXS 0646-176 had an SDSS r-magnitude = 17.45+/-0.04 (AB-system). This result suggests that there is significant enhancement in its optical magnitude. For example, an historic value of this object's r-magnitude from PanSTARRS at mean epoch 09-31-2013 is 19.0835 (Chambers et al. 2016, arXiv:1612.05560).

53,ATEL #12294,"Transient, Variables The g=11.2 optical transient ASASSN-18abj (AT 2018jro) was discovered on 2018-12-12.109 UT by the ASAS-SN survey and reported to the Transient Name Server. R. Fidrich confirmed the object on 2018-12-12.292 UT at V=10.8 (vsnet-alert 22827). T. Vanmunster found fast irregular variability with ~0.05mag amplitude based on a 3.6hr-long time series (vsnet-alert 22828). We observed ASASSN-18abj with Swift for 2 ks on 2018-12-13.363 UT. Swift/XRT detected a bright (0.101 +/-0.007 cts/s) X-ray source at the position of the transient. The source spectrum is soft implying negligible Galactic absorption and can be fit by the thermal plasma model (APEC) with kT=10 +/-5 keV. The power-law model with the photon index of 1.5 +/-0.1 also provides an acceptable fit. The integrated 0.3-10 keV fluxes are (4.0 +/-0.4)x10^-12 and (4.2 +/-0.4)x10^-12 ergs/cm^2/s for the APEC and power-law models, respectively. Introducing an absorption component with free n_H1 into the model results in n_H1<10^21 cm^-2, consistent with zero within the uncertainties. The source is saturated in the UVOT ultraviolet image suggesting its magnitude UVW2<11 (Vega system). The total Galactic absorbing column in the direction of this source is n_H1 = 5.33x10^21 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005 A&A, 440, 775) and the optical extinction is E(B-V)=0.824 (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011, ApJ, 737, 103), implying a UVW2 band extinction of 6.8mag (Roming et al. 2009, ApJ, 690, 163). Both the absence of detectable X-ray absorption and UV brightness of the source suggest that ASASSN-18abj is nearby, foreground to much of the Galactic column. Therefore, this object is unlikely to be a classical nova but may be a high-amplitude, WZ Sge-type, dwarf nova, perhaps similar to, but more distant than, GW Lib (Hiroi et al. 2009 PASJ, 61, 697 and Byckling et al. 2009, MNRAS, 399, 1567).

The powerlaw model fits a little worse with the photon index = 2.7 +- 0.4.

55,ATEL #12288,"Following the reported radio revival of the magnetar XTE J1810-197 (ATel #12284) and subsequent detection at high-frequencies (ATel #12285), we conducted low-frequency observations of the pulsar with the 1.6km Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope as part of the UTMOST project (Bailes et al. 2017). A single 20 minute observation was performed at 835 MHz with 31 MHz of bandwidth at 02:38:32 UTC on December 12, 2018 (MJD 58464.11). The pulsar was tracked using a tied array beam as it transited through the Molonglo primary beam, resulting in a final integrated signal-to-noise ratio of 46.1. Throughout the observation we detected a number of bright single pulses, many with individual signal-to-noise ratios in excess of 7.

56,ATEL #12287,"As part of the ThunderKAT Large Survey Programme (Fender et al.2017, arXiv:1711.04132), the recurrent black hole transient GX 339-4 is observed regularly (on a weekly basis, usually on week-end) with the new MeerKAT radio telescope. Between September 2018 - 24 November 2018 the source remained in quiescence indicating a flux density upper limit <100uJy. The last MeerKAT observations showed that GX 339-4 is starting a new outburst. We report on the fluxes of three observing epochs, 0.25h each. Observations on 2018-11-24 10:18 (60 antennas) reveal a detection of a point source at the position of GX 339-4 with flux density 439+/-7 uJy. On 2018-12-02 09:44 (62 antennas), the source shows an increase in flux density to 868+/-19 uJy and on 2018-12-08 09:18 (63 antennas) the flux density of GX 339-4 is 1631+/-12 uJy. All observations were taken at a central frequency of 1.284 GHz with a total bandwidth of 860MHz. GX 339-4 shows a recurrent outburst activity (Corbel et al. 2013, MNRAS, 428, 2500), which makes it an ideal target to study the correlation of radio and X-ray luminosities, highlighting the disk to outflows connection. Although, X-ray observations are currently not feasible due to sun constraints, radio observations will help us to cover the initial phase of the outburst. Further monitoring is ongoing. ThunderKAT will run for 5 years and aims to monitor all bright, active, southern hemisphere X-ray binaries in the radio band. For further information on this programme please contact Rob Fender and/or Patrick Woudt.

57,ATEL #12284,"The magnetar XTE J1810-197, discovered following an X-ray outburst in 2003 (Ibrahim et al. 2004), was the first magnetar to have detected radio pulsations (Camilo et al. 2006). The onset of the radio emission appeared to be connected with the X-ray outburst. As the X-ray flux decayed over time (Bernardini et al. 2011), so did the radio flux until late 2008, when the source was no longer visible at radio frequencies (Camilo et al. 2016). We are regularly monitoring XTE J1810-197 with the 76-m Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory. After 10 years in this quiescent state, intense radio emission from XTE J1810-197 was observed to have resumed on 2018 December 8 (MJD 58460.6), with a signal to noise ratio of over 400 in a 30-minute observation with a 384-MHz wide band centered at 1532 MHz. The spin-period measured over the two days following the re-detection observation (P = 5.5414391(1) s on MJD 58461.5) is somewhat smaller than value (P = 5.541463 s) obtained from a 460-day extrapolation of the ephemeris derived from XMM-Newton, Chandra and NICER data (Pintore et al. 2018). The pulse shape is not dissimilar to shapes observed during some phases of the previous outburst at the same frequency. Our last non-detection of the source was observed on 2018 October 26 (MJD 58417), with the Lovell Telescope. XTE J1810-197 was also monitored at higher frequencies with the 100-m Effelsberg Radio Telescope since early 2018, using the new C-X band receiver (4-8 GHz). The latest observation was collected on September 10 (MJD 58371) and no detection was made. Additional observations are now planned. We find no reports of increased X-ray emission of the source, although X-ray observations are currently restricted by the proximity of the source's line of sight to the Sun.

Two consecutive observations, each lasting about 20 minutes and utilizing receivers operating at 4.74 GHz and 8.35 GHz with 500 MHz bandwidth, were initiated on December 11th 2018, 13h17 UTC (MJD 58463.5). The data were folded in real-time using a rotational period as predicted by the Jodrell Bank observations (Atel #12284). Highly significant detections have been made at each frequency with measured average flux densities of 22.5+/-0.2 mJy at 4.74 GHz and 14.9+/-0.2 mJy at 8.35 GHz, giving a spectral index of -0.7. Evidence for bright single pulse emission is present throughout each of the 20-min integrations. The average pulse profiles have changed morphology since earlier observations at similar frequencies, and no longer exhibit signs of interpulse emission (Lazaridis et al. 2008). Some frequency evolution in profile shape is observed in this data. Consistent with other radio magnetars, the pulse profiles are nearly 100% linearly polarised (e.g. ATel #5064) and exhibit about 10 per cent circular polarisation. The polarisation angle of the linear polarisation show a clear swing at each frequency. Continued radio monitoring has started and higher frequency observations are scheduled.

59,ATEL #12286,"We report a new redshift value of 0.0179 &plusmn; 0.0003 for SN2018ilu, this redshift was obtained from narrow and spatially extended Halpha emission coincident with the position of the host of SN2018ilu. The observations we were performed on the night of 2018 November 30 at the 4.1-m SOAR telescope equipped with the Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph using the 400 lines/mm grating, and a slit width of 1.0 arc second. From the 2D spectrum, we find that the peak of the Halpha emission is located 9.87 arc seconds to the north-west of the SN position, at a projected distance of about 3.6 kpc at the redshift of the SN. The previous value reported by Berton et al. 2018 in ATel #12216 was obtained by fitting spectral templates to the classification spectrum, the template method yields more uncertain redshift values, particularly at early phases when the spectral diversity is large. The value reported here makes more consistent the spectral and photometric evolution of SN2018ilu with a bright but normal SN Ia."

62,ATEL #12283,"Following the discovery of the soft X-ray transient MAXI J1810-222 (Negoro et al. ATel #12254; Maruyama et al. #12264), we requested NuSTAR ToO observations. From 08:57 to 20:20 on 2018 December 9, NuSTAR performed mosaic 5x5 observations, approximately 600 sec each. It covered a 52'x52' region centering at (R.A., Dec) =(273.006, -22.418), which was obtained from the latest MAXI data at that time. NuSTAR FPMA and FPMB clearly detected a source at the position (R.A., Dec) = (273.1226, -22.3274) with an uncertainty of 2 arcmin. In the observations, the optical star camera used for aspect reconstruction was unavailable because of the proximity to the Sun, resulting in the relatively large errors. This position is within the MAXI error region above, but outside of the refined position (ATel #12264). We note that there is no known X-ray source within the error region. The preliminary analysis shows a steep energy spectrum with no apparent hard tail. The 3-10 keV spectrum is represented by a power-law with a photon index of 5.5 +/- 0.3, or a blackbody or disk blackbody model with 0.6-0.7 keV. The 4-10 keV flux was 1.3e-11 erg/s. These are consistent with a recent MAXI/GSC spectrum. The nature of the source is still unknown. A further deep NuSTAR observation will be carried out, followup observations, e.g., in the radio band, are highly encouraged to reveal this peculiar soft X-ray transient."

67,ATEL #12277,"Blazar, Quasar The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, has observed increasing gamma-ray emission from a source positionally consistent with the flat spectrum radio quasar object OQ 334 (also known as B2 1420+32, GB2 1420+326 and 3FGL J1422.4+3227) with radio coordinates (J2000) R.A.: 215.626579deg, Dec.: 32.386233deg (Petrov & Taylor 2011, AJ, 142, 89). This blazar has a redshift z=0.6819 (Hewett & Wild 2010, MNRAS, 405, 2302). OQ 334 (B2 1420+32) has brightened in GeV gamma rays since 2018 December 5. In particular, preliminary analysis indicates that on 2018 December 7, OQ 334 was in a high state with a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV) of (1.3+/-0.2) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty only), almost 180 times greater than its four-year average flux reported in the third Fermi-LAT source catalog (3FGL, Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23). The corresponding single power-law photon spectral index (E>100 MeV) of 1.8+/-0.1 (statistical uncertainty only) is smaller (i.e. harder spectrum) than the 3FGL catalog value of 2.56+/-0.21. The peak 6-hour integrated gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV) of (2.5+/-0.5) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 was reached by OQ 334 on 2018 December 7 in the interval 00:00-06:00 UT, and was about 340 times greater than the average flux reported in the 3FGL catalog. This is the first time that an increasing gamma-ray flux trend for this source is announced with a telegram by the Fermi LAT Collaboration after more than 10 years of Fermi LAT all-sky survey observations. The source will be inserted in the ""<a href="" "">LAT Monitored Sources</a>"" table at FSSC, and consequently preliminary estimations of the daily and weekly gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi LAT will be publicly available. Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring of this source will continue. In consideration of the ongoing activity of this source, we encourage multiwavelength observations. For this source the Fermi LAT contact person is S. Ciprini (stefano.ciprini@ssdc.asi.it). The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden."

Buson, I have observed the source on 2018-12-08.75 with the 30cm telescope of the Foligno Observatory (IAU K56). Comparison stars were taken from the UCAC4 catalog and aperture photometry was made with IRAF/apphot: the source was detected at V=16.9 +-0.08. The magnitude of this FSRQ in the recent Gaia DR2 catalog is G=16.6, consistent with our value given the different passbands. A similar value is reported in the older GSC2.3.2 catalog (V=16.5). Apparently the enhancement in Gamma-ray flux is not related to the optical one, at variance with the majority of blazars."
69,ATEL #12273,"The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, has observed increasing gamma-ray activity from a source positionally consistent with the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 2134+004 (also known as OX 057 and DA 553) with radio coordinates (J2000) R.A.: 324.160776 deg, Dec.: 0.698392deg, (Johnston 1995, AJ, 110, 880) and with redshift z=1.944603 (Hewett et al., 2010, MNRAS, 405, 2302). This source is not in any published LAT catalog and was not detected by AGILE or EGRET. Preliminary analysis indicates that PKS 2134+004 was detected with high confidence by the Fermi-LAT in the past ten days (2018-Nov-26 / 2018-Dec-06), at an average flux of (6.3 +/- 0.6) X 10^-7 photons cm^-2 s^-1. On 2018 December 4, the source reached a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (1.5+/-0.2) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 with a single power-law photon index of 2.4+/-0.2 (statistical uncertainty only). PKS 2134+004 continued to be detected on a daily basis on 2018 December 5 and 6 with daily averaged gamma-ray fluxes (E>100 MeV) respectively of (1.3+/-0.2) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 and (1.2+/-0.3) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1. The corresponding photon spectral indexes (E>100 MeV) of 2.3+/-0.2 and 2.4+/-0.2 suggest a rather stable spectral state during the current flaring state. Because this is a new detection of this source, we strongly encourage further multifrequency observations of this object. Since Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring of this source will continue. PKS 2134+004 is being added to the ""LAT Monitored Sources"" and consequently a preliminary estimation of the daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi-LAT will be publicly available ( ).

No candidate events were recorded within three degrees of the blazar coordinates during this period. This yields a preliminary 90% confidence level upper limit on the muon-neutrino fluence from a point source of 4.5 GeV.cm^-2 over the energy range 4.7 TeV - 4.1 PeV (the range corresponding to 5-95% of the detectable flux) for an E^-2 power-law spectrum.

74,ATEL #12269,"Since April 2016, some 10 neutrino Icecube events have been made public (see   and   ). The AGILE team embarked in a search for transient gamma-ray sources (>100 MeV) temporally and spatially coincident with these neutrino events and found 3 gamma-ray sources coincident with them (Lucarelli et al., 2018). For one of these sources (B), we recently (March 2018) obtained an optical spectrum of the most interesting counterpart, the HSP blazar 2WHSP J062753.2-151956 (Chang et al., 2017) which is associated to the Fermi gamma-ray source 3FGLJ0627.9-1517. The spectrum of this object (g = 19.4) was obtained at the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias using OSIRIS (exposure time = 6000 sec and spectral range = 4100-7700 Ang). The spectrum is characterized by the combination of a power-law emission and starlight from host galaxy typical of BL Lac object of low nucleus-to-host ratio. We clearly detect absorption features due to CaII doublet, G-band, and H_beta at z= 0.3102. The spectrum is reported in our online ZBLLac database ( ). At this redshift the AGILE gamma-ray luminosity is ~2x10^46 erg s-1, comparable to that of TXS0506+056 (AGILE source C). ZBLLAC: A spectroscopic library of BL Lac objects:  "

77,ATEL #12263,"Transient, Tidal Disruption Event The source AT2018hco was discovered by ATLAS on 2018-Oct-04 and reported to TNS on 2018-Oct-05. The source was also detected on the rise in ZTF partnership data, with a first detection on 2018-Sep-18. The fading part of the light curve, which is part of public ZTF MSIP data and reported to TNS on 2018-Nov-04, shows a blue and constant color (g-r ~ -0.1). We report the classification of AT2018hco based on Swift/UVOT and ground-based spectroscopic follow-up observations. Our SEDM (Blagorodnova, PASP, 130, 2018) spectrum, obtained 2018-Oct-26, showed a blue continuum with no significant emission lines. Follow-up spectroscopy with Keck/LRIS, obtained 2018-Dec-1, showed broad Halpha emission and broad He I (5876) emission. From Ca H, and K absorption we determine a redshift of z~0.09. We requested Swift observations on 2018-Nov-15. These were obtained on 2018-Nov-29 and showed the transient is UV-bright. We measure UVW2=18.67 +/- 0.07 (AB), implying a blue UV-optical color: UVW2-g ~ 0. The source is not detected in XRT. The TDE classification is based on the location in the center of the host galaxy (offset 0.1 +/- 0.1 arcsec), blue and constant color post peak, the detection of broad H and He in the optical spectrum, and finally the UV detection in Swift/UVOT. The source shows no prior variability in ZTF, PTF, or CRTS data. The W1-W2 color, based on unWISE forced photometry (Lang 2014 arXiv:1410.7397), is 0.07 +/- 0.09, indicating a quiescent host galaxy. Follow-up with VLA, AMI, XMM, and Spitzer has been triggered. We encourage further follow-up of this source, in particular spectroscopic monitoring and multi-band imaging.

78,ATEL #12264,"We further report analysis results using MAXI/GSC data of the newly discovered soft X-ray transient MAXI J1810-222 (Negoro et al. ATel #12254). Longterm GSC light curves show that the 2-4 keV X-ray flux has gradually increased since the beginning of November (~ MJD 58425) except for the period from November 18 to 27 when MAXI could not observe the region, and that the 4-10 keV X-ray flux shows slight excess of 0.0034 +/- 0.0023 c/cm^2/s (~ 3 mCrab) only from MJD 58420 to 58430. On December 2 (MJD 58454), the 2-4 keV and 4-10 keV fluxes changed from 0.027 +/- 0.004 c/cm^2/s (on December 1) to 0.014 +/- 0.004 c/cm^2/s, and from 0.002 +/- 0.004 c/cm^2/s to 0.007 +/- 0.004 c/cm^2/s, respectively, which may indicate the source is undergoing some transition. The time averaged energy spectrum obtained on November 29-31 is well represented by a blackbody model with a temperature of 0.36 (+0.10, -0.08) keV, or by an absorbed blackbody model with a temperate of 0.34 (+0.09, -0.08) keV and a fixed column density to the direction of 6.36e-21 atoms/cm^2 obtained at HEASARC ( ). The flux and unabsorbed flux of the above models are 2.2e-10 erg/cm^2/s in the 2-10 keV band in both case, and 1.29e-9 and 0.92e-9 erg/cm^2/s, respectively, in the 0.8-60 keV band. The size of the emission region, the blackbody radius, is hardly constrained, but the best-fit parameters show the radii of 80 (d/10 kpc) km and 100 (d/10kpc) km for the models, respectively. Optically thin thermal plasma models with kT ~ 0.7-0.8 keV also represent the observed spectrum. The 90% upper-limit of the 4-20 keV flux is 1.5e-11 erg/cm^2/s if we assume the power-law model with a photon index of 1. We also obtained the refined position of the source using 15 scan data from 22:15 on November 30 to 20:34 on December 1: (R.A., Dec) = (272.634 deg, -22.309 deg) = (18 10 32, -22 18 32) (J2000) with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short radii of 0.27 deg and 0.21 deg, respectively. The roll angle of the long axis from the north direction is 101.0 deg counterclockwise. There is an additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment radius). Similar soft X-ray spectra were obtained in Aql X-1 with a luminosity of less than 5e35 erg/s at 0.8-100 keV (Sakurai et al. 2014, PASJ, 66, 10, also see MAXI J1807+132, Shidatsu et al. 2017, ApJ, 850, 115). If this is the case, the source distance becomes less than 1.9 kpc. A (massive) black hole binary in the soft state at a distance of, say, ~10 kpc might also be possible. However, in both cases, a hard power-law or tail component must be present, which is not confirmed, yet. Some magnetars also exhibit such a soft thermal component with kT ~ 0.5 keV (e.g., Enoto et al. 2017, ApJS, 231, 8, and references therein). In such case, the source distance must be ~1 kpc from the blackbody radius, and a hard-tail is also expected. Finally, we note that these is a possibility of a new type of X-ray star because MAXI has not detected such a long-lived, soft X-ray transient without seeing a hard state. Followup observations especially in the hard X-ray band to detect a hard tail are encouraged to reveal the nature of the source."

It shows clear Halpha and [S II] lines. By comparing the SN and the host galaxy spectra, we conclude that these emission lines are from a HII region of the host. The light curve of SN2018jhf had a fast rise of 1.5 mag in 2 days. The last non-detection was 12 days before our spectral observations, suggesting that the luminosity will continue increasing for a few more days. Adopting a standard cosmology with H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, we obtain a distance modulus of 37.1 mag. This gives a current absolute magnitude of about -19.1. Taking into account this previous analysis, the object could reach a peak absolute magnitude of around -20 mag, being too high for both SN 91T-like and Ic. This picture could be explained by a superchandra scenario. A new spectrum will be necessary to help to clarify the spectral type."

On Dec 3rd 2018 the MAGIC telescopes observed this source for about 2 hours under good weather conditions. The source was detected at VHE gamma-rays above 90 GeV with a significance larger than 5 sigma. The preliminary analysis yields an estimate of the VHE gamma-ray flux above 90 GeV of ~10-15% of the flux from the Crab Nebula above the same energy threshold, and a spectral index of ~4. This flux is consistent with the emission level integrated between September 28th 2017 to October 3rd 2017, when the source was discovered at VHE gamma-rays (ATel #10817).

89,ATEL #12254,"We report the MAXI/GSC detection of a soft X-ray transient MAXI J1820-222. The source is seen on GSC images at least on 29th and 30th November 2018 only in the 2-4 keV band. The 2-4 keV X-ray flux is about 20-40 mCrab. No significant time variations are recognized. Assuming that the source flux was constant over the transit, we obtain the source position at (R.A., Dec) = (272.732 deg, -22.280 deg) = (18 10 55, -22 16 48) (J2000) with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short radii of 0.32 deg and 0.26 deg, respectively. The roll angle of the long axis from the north direction is 108.0 deg counterclockwise. There is an additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment radius). There is no bright catalogued X-ray source in the error region except for a few ROSAT X-ray sources, e.g., 1RXS J181011.5-222515 (13.3 arcmin apart), 1RXS J181026.5-223424 (18.9 arcmin). This transient has an unusually soft X-ray spectrum and a duration of more than 1 day, suggesting that the source is a LMXB hosting a neutron star or black hole in the soft state. Other possibilities, however, can not be excluded, and we tentatively name the source MAXI J1810-222. Followup observations are strongly encouraged though the source is currently close to the sun (~25 deg). Transient Information on MAXI J1810-222:  "
90,ATEL #12252,"Blazar, Quasar, Gravitational Lensing The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of the two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, has observed increasing gamma-ray flux from a source positionally consistent with PKS 1830-211, also known as 3FGL J1833.6-2103 (Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23) with radio coordinates (J2000) R.A.: 278.416201 deg, Dec.: -21.061048 deg (van Ommen et al., 1995, ApJ, 444, 561). PKS 1830-211 is a flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) placed at redshift z=2.507 (Lovell et al. 1998, ApJ, 508, L51), having intervening absorption systems and being subject to gravitational lensing by a galaxy at z=0.886 (Wiklind & Combes 1996, Nature, 379, 11). In the past PKS 1830-211 showed major GeV gamma-ray outburst activity in 2010 (Abdo et al. 2015, ApJ, 799, 143). PKS 1830-211 has been recently bright in GeV gamma rays for several months, and was reported last October in ATel#12136 by the Fermi LAT Collaboration. Preliminary analysis indicates that on 2018 November 29, the prolonged outburst of this source further increased, reaching a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV) of (4.2+/-0.6)X10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty only), with corresponding photon spectral index (E>100 MeV) of 2.3+/-0.2. The gamma-ray flux was above the 3.0X10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 level the previous three days (Nov. 26, 27 and 28) as well. GeV gamma-ray activity of PKS 1830-211 has been announced four times since 2009 by the Fermi LAT Collaboration (ATel#12136, ATel#6361, ATel#4158, ATel#2943) and two times by the AGILE Collaboration (ATel#2242, ATel#2950). Also on 2018 November 29 the LAT observed increasing gamma-ray flux from a source positionally consistent with TXS 0646-176, also known as 3FGL J0648.8-1740, with radio coordinates (J2000) R.A.: 102.118744 deg, Dec.:-17.734844 deg (Petrov et al. 2006, AJ, 131, 1872), and redshift z=1.232 (Hewitt & Burbidge 1993, ApJS, 87, 451). Preliminary analysis indicates that TXS 0646-176 on November 29 reached a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV) of (1.5+/-0.1)X10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1, with corresponding photon spectral index (E>100 MeV) of 2.4+/-0.1. GeV gamma-ray activity of TXS 0646-176 has been announced on two previous occasions by the Fermi LAT Collaboration. Both the sources are included in the list of publicly monitored sources, with their preliminary light curves that can be found at <a href="" "">FSSC</a> Because Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring of these sources will continue. In consideration of their ongoing activity we strongly encourage multiwavelength observations. For both the sources the Fermi LAT contact person is S. Ciprini (stefano.ciprini@ssdc.asi.it). The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan, and Sweden."

Hydrogen Balmer series (H&alpha; - H&delta;), Fe II, and O I P Cygni profiles are all clearly observed. There may be some evidence for Si II (6347/6371) and He I P Cygni profiles also being present. The terminal velocity of the H&alpha; P Cygni profile is around 4000 km/s.

Here we report the disappearance of the SSS emission back towards quiescence on November 25th. The entire 2018 eruption was monitored by the <a href="" "">Neil Gehrels Swift observatory</a> and a comprehensive multi-wavelength analysis is in preparation following these preliminary findings: After the last detection in a 6.1-ks Swift/XRT pointing on 2018-11-24.45 UT, with a faint count rate of (0.3&plusmn;0.1) &times; 10<SUP>-2</SUP> ct/s, no source was found in the subsequent 4.7-ks observation on 2018-11-25.12 UT (3&sigma; upper limit of 0.3 &times; 10<SUP>-2</SUP> ct/s). Consequently, we estimate an SSS turn-off time of around 18 days after the discovery date on 2018-11-06.80 UT (ATel #12177). This SSS turn-off time is overall consistent with the equivalent time scales observed for the eruptions in 2013 (day 19&plusmn;1; <a href="" "">Henze et al. 2014</a>), 2014 (day 18.4&plusmn;0.5; ATel #6604 and <a href="" "">Henze et al. 2015a</a>), 2015 (day 18.6&plusmn;0.7; ATel #8062 and <a href="" "">Darnley et al. 2016</a>), and 2017 (prior to day 18; ATel #11214 and Henze et al. in preparation). We note that all these time scales are significantly longer than for the peculiar 2016 eruption where the SSS phase had ended before day 16 (ATel #9907 and Henze et al. <a href="" "">2018</a>). We wish to thank the Swift Team for the scheduling of the observations and for the successful 2018 monitoring campaign, in particular B. Cenko, the duty scientists, and the science planners."

The spectrum is consistent with that of a subluminous type Ia supernova at a few days before the maximum light. Cross correlation with a library of supernova spectra using the GELATO (Harutyunyan et al. 2008, A&A, 488,383) shows that it matched SN 1986G at about t=-3 days before the maximum light. After correcting for a redshift of 0.04 for its host galaxy MCG +02-03-030 (Hopp et al. 1995,A&AS, 109, 537), an expansion velocity of about 12700 km/s can be derived from the absorption minimum of Si II 635.5 nm line."

The spectra are consistent with that of a young type II supernova that suffered significant host-galaxy reddening, with the equivalent width of the Na I absorption being measured as about 2.5 Angstrom. A prominent absorption feature detected at around 627.0 nm can be due to the Ha line. The narrow Ha emission supposed on the continuum seems to show a double peak structure, with an FWHM velocity of 1200 km/s. Adopting a redshift of 0.0038 for the host galaxy (Huchra et al. 1999, ApJS,121, 287), an expansion velocity of 13500 km/s can be inferred for this SN. Followup observations are encouraged."

During the first outburst, the source was detected by S-CUBED between MJD 57736.97 - 57764.57 (over 27.6 days starting Dec 14th, 2016), peaking at a flux of (1.0 +/- 0.4) x 10^-11 erg/s/cm^2 (0.5 - 10 keV). The second outburst is currently ongoing and was first detected on MJD 58407.54 (Oct 16th, 2018) peaking at (1.5 +/- 0.5) x 10^-11 erg/s/cm^2 (0.5 - 10 keV) during the most recent observation on MJD 58442.34 (Nov 20th, 2018). Outside of these two outbursts, no X-rays have been detected from SXP 304. The reported optically derived orbital period of SXP 304 is P = 520 +/- 12 days (Schmidtke and Cowley, 2006, AJ,132, 919), although the detection of that period was weak. Subsequently Bird et al (2012, MNRAS 423, 366) failed to find any convincing evidence for a binary period in the OGLE III & IV data sets. If the two outbursts seen by S-CUBED are due to Type-1 outbursts (i.e. the periastron passage of the Neutron Star), then this would be incompatible with the purported 520 day period. The two outbursts are separated by ~662 days, and we suggest this as a candidate orbital period of SXP 304."
104,ATEL #12237,"In ATel #12224 we reported the H&alpha; emission, derived from a wide-field photometric survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud (Maravelias et al. 2017, IAUS 329, 373; Maravelias et al. 2019, in prep.), of the proposed optical counterpart source [M2002] 20671 to the X-ray transient XTE J0052-723 pulsar (SXP 4.78; Swift J005139.2-721704; ATel #12209). In addition to this clear detection, the work of Bonanos et al. (2010, AJ, 140, 416) showed that the IR colors of this source ([2dFS]0811; J=15.54 mag, J-[3.6]=0.56 mag) are indicative of a ""photometric"" Be star, defined as sources with an intrinsic color of J<SUB>IRSF</SUB>-[3.6]>0.5 mag. However, to confirm the nature of the counterpart optical spectroscopy is needed. We obtained optical spectra using the LDSS-3 spectrograph on the 6.5m Clay/Magellan telescope (Las Campanas Observatory). The observations were performed on Nov. 20, 2018, acquiring two exposures of 600s each with a 1&Prime; slit using the VPH-All grism (resulting in a 2630 -- 10859 &#8491; wavelength range, at a nominal dispersion of 1.9 &#8491;/pix). The spectrum shows a clear single-peaked H&alpha; line in emission, with a corresponding equivalent width of -10.65&plusmn;0.14 &#8491;. This is the first optical spectroscopic confirmation of the presence of H&alpha; in emission. We note that H&beta; appears in emission as well. The spectral classification was based on the blue part of the spectrum and the classification scheme used in Maravelias et al. (2014, MNRAS, 438, 2005). The presence of the OII+CIII 4640-4650 blend and the strong HeI 4471 line point to an early-type star (spectral type up to B2), which is consistent with the absence of the MgII 4481 line and the weak SiII 4552 triplet line. The HeII 4200 and 4686 lines, which are indicative of B0.5 and earlier-spectral types, are absent, thus pointing to later types. Combining these criteria we constrain the optical classification to a B1-2e source (with an error of 0.5 subtype). This is consistent with the early-type B star classification proposed in ATel #12229, as well as the previous classification of B0-B3 by Evans et al. (2004, MNRAS, 351, 601; source ID [2dFS]0811). Thus, we provide the first optical spectrum with H&alpha; emission of the optical counterpart of XTE J0052-723, further confirming its Be/X-ray binary nature."

The S/N ratio was > 10 in the continuum with the Halpha peak at about 40+/-2 times the continuum. The Halpha profile shows broad, extended wings at 10 to 15 percent of the peak intensity extending to +/-1000 km/s. The Oct 31 Halpha profile shows a superimposed absorption with a blue edge at -300 km/s that had weakened by Nov. 19 but with the blue side of the emission decidedly asymmetric compared to the red wing (reversal of the profile shows the absorption extends to nearly zero vrad). The low resolution spectrum shows little evidence other than profile asymmetry for absorption at Halpha and Hbeta, aside from a complex of Fe II emission lines there is a pronounced presence of the neutral He lines. He I 4922 and 5013 are much stronger than Fe II 4923 and 5018; Fe II 5169 is present but weak.

109,ATEL #12229,"A new X-ray transient, designated Swift J005139.2-721704, was reported in Atel #12209 by Coe et al. Subsequently this region was observed by NICER and a pulse period of 4.78 s reported (ATel #12222). Those authors (Strohmayer et al) proposed that this object was associated with a previously known RXTE pulsar (XTE 0052-723 = SXP 4.78) discovered by Corbet et al in 2001 (IAUC 7562). That source had never been successfully associated with an optical counterpart due to the lack of imaging from RXTE. However the Swift position of the current transient unambiguously associates Swift J005139.2-721704 with the OB star [M2002] SMC 20671. Further analysis of the OGLE III and IV data on [M2002] SMC 20671 were carried out. In light of the proposed identification of this transient with a 4.78s pulsar it was decided to explore the period range below the 2 days that was previously reported. The result was a strong detection of a period at 1.805d, with a second somewhat weaker peak at the beat frequency between that period and the 1 day typical sampling. Folding the data at that period reveals a sinusoidal-like average lightcurve. If this is the true binary period, then it is so short there is no time for the circumstellar disk to generate the classic FRED-like modulation seen in much longer binary period systems. The observed average colour and magnitude of [M2002] SMC 20671 determined from OGLE are V-I = 0.13 and I = 15.5. This suggests that the object is not a main sequence star in the SMC unless exceptional reddening (for objects in the SMC) is introduced. Without such exceptional reddening the colours are that of a late B-type, early A-type star. A blue spectrum was obtained from SALT on 16 November 2018 to investigate the spectral classification of [M2002] SMC 20671. The spectral lines are somewhat narrower than one might expect from a dwarf (luminosity class V) star, but unlikely to be narrow enough to justify a supergiant classification. The V=15.6 makes it also unlikely to be a SG. Certainly the spectrum is not consistent with an early A-type - the lines of neutral helium are still strong enough in this object to constrain it to being a B star. Overall the SALT spectrum combined with the OGLE colours suggest most probably that of a considerably reddened early type B star in the SMC. Assuming that this binary period of 1.8 d and the 4.78 s pulsations period are coming from the same system, then it can be located on the Corbet diagram. It sits in the region populated by the two Magellanic Cloud, Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) systems, LMC X-4 and SMC X-1. But we note that unlike the system that is the subject of this report, both of those systems have supergiant mass donor stars. It seems unlikely that [M2002] SMC 20671 is a SG, hence we have the first Be/X-ray binary possibly identified as a RLOF system. New Swift observations taken on 18 November 2018 show that the system has doubled in brightness in just 3 days and hence further observations at all wavelengths are encouraged to try and understand this apparently unusual system."

111,ATEL #12227,"The symbiotic binary V694 Mon shows regular outbursts with the period of 1930 days (Doroshenko et al., IBVS No.3824, 1993) above the secular trend of brightening from B = 14.1 mag in 1898 to B = 9.25 mag in 2016. The star reached the breaking-record brightness in the last 2016 outburst (ATel#8653) predicted with the known period. Broad and deep blue-shifted absorption components of Balmer emission lines in the spectra formed by high-velocity jets, and strong flickering of brightness in the scales of minutes and hours with the amplitude up to 0.8 mag in the V band and 1.0 mag in the U band are typical for this star. On 2018 Nov 4.12 UT we observed brightening of the star up to the UBVRc magnitudes of (9.15, 9.57, 9.25, 8.50), consequently. Observations were performed with the SAO 1-m Zeiss telescope and CCD photometer. Additional analysis of the photometry taken with the 50-cm Maksutov telescope of the Moscow University Crimean Station along with SAO data found the star in this state in five nights between 2018 Oct 11 and Nov 5. Its V brightness varied less than 0.07 mag, what suggests the disappearance of flickering. A previous observation taken on 2018 May 2 at the end of the past observational season gave UBVRc = (10.31, 10.52, 10.22, 9.41), and flickering was then observed. The recent brightening happened at the phase of 0.52 of 1930-day period, and it was not predicted. The spectral observations were performed with the SAO 1-m telescope and UAGS spectrograph. In the spectra of V694 Mon taken around 2018 Nov 16.04 UT in the range between 3870 and 5280 &Aring; with the spectral resolution of 2.2 &Aring;, we found the radical changes in comparison with the spectra of the previous season. No high-velocity absorption components are seen. H&beta; line has wide emission shoulders spreading to the velocities up to 1000 km/s in both sides from the line center. There is a weak absorption component at the velocity of -260 km/s relative to the peak of the emission. Higher-number Balmer lines do not have emission shoulders but have the absorption components at the velocity of -260 km/s. The depths of them increase with the number. Wide and shallow He I absorptions changed to narrower ones located on the velocity of -260 km/s. Peaks of the Fe II emission lines are shifted by -50 km/s relative to the peaks of Balmer lines. The same features are presented in the UAGS spectrum taken on 2018 Oct 17.10 UT in the range of 3800 - 7880 &Aring; with the lower resolution of 6.2 &Aring;/pxl. While the last spectra taken at the past season from January 9 to March 9, 2018 looked typical for this star with the high-velocity absorption components. We explain this active state of the V694 Mon system as an episode of the formation of a common envelope due to the transit of the system to a dynamical mode of accretion with an increased rate. The accretion matter filling the Roche lobe of the compact companion blocked the jets and overlapped the direct visibility of the companion, so flickering was deleted. The shell of the companion generates a stellar wind with the velocity of 260 km/s. We observed similar episodes in the relativistic jet binary SS 433 with blocking jets and even the disappearance of eclipses. In SS 433, these episodes finish with an ejection of the envelope.

113,ATEL #12225,"Aquila X-1 is one of the neutron star LMXB transients with frequent outbursts in the past few decades. It has been inactive in the X-ray band for about 250 days since its latest outburst reported in 2018 Feb (e.g. Atel#11382). The hard X-ray monitoring observations performed with Swift/BAT indicated that the X-ray intensity of Aquila X-1 in the 15-50 keV band has increased from 13+/-11 mCrab to 38+/-9 mCrab in the last 10 days, which suggests that Aquila X-1 may be in a new X-ray outburst again. However, the sun angle of Aquila X-1 is lower than 60 degrees. Therefore it was uncertain whether the enhance X-ray flux came from the source or not. Therefore, we proposed a Swift ToO pointed observation towards Aquila X-1 to confirm if it is indeed in a new X-ray outburst. The Swift/XRT observation was performed with the WT mode for about 500 seconds, starting at 17:19:04 of 2018-11-17 (UTC). We did a quick analysis of the XRT data only. The net XRT X-ray count rate was 30.4+/-0.3 cps, corresponding to about 50 mCrab in the XRT band. We fitted the XRT energy spectrum in the 0.6-10 keV band with an absorbed power-law model, which gave a hydrogen column density of 3.0+/-0.2 x10^21 cm^-2 and a power-law index of 1.81+/-0.04. The X-ray flux in the 0.6-10 keV energy band is estimated as 1.65+/-0.03 x10^-9 ergs/s/cm^2, corresponding to an X-ray luminosity of 3.0x10^36 ergs/s at a source distance of 3.9 kpc.

It is located 2.2&Prime; away from the Swift position (ATel #12209), with H&alpha; and R-band magnitudes equal to 15.476&plusmn;0.006 and 15.613&plusmn;0.008, respectively. The resulting H&alpha;-R color is -0.137&plusmn;0.010 mag with an SNR~13 above the continuum and an H&alpha; excess significance of ~6&sigma; above the H&alpha;-R baseline value. The only nearby source with significant H&alpha;-R excess is much fainter (H&alpha; and R ~22 mag), has a lower SNR (~4) and is located at a larger distance from the X-ray source (~6&Prime;). Observations with the IMACS f/2 camera on the 6.5m Magellan Telescope (4 October 2004) give B=15.652&plusmn;0.009 mag and I=15.524&plusmn;0.017 mag (Strantzalis et al. 2018, IAUS 344, 453; Strantzalis et al. 2019, in prep.), compatible with an OB star. All the identifications described above secure the nature of Swift J005139.2-721704 = XTE J0052-723 = SXP 4.78 as Be-XRB pulsar in the SMC."
116,ATEL #12220,"Neutron Star, Transient, Variables Further Swift observations of Swift J1858.6-0814 (Atel: #12151, #12158, #12163, #12167, #12180, #12184, #12186, #12197) reveal evidence for significant absorption intrinsic to the source. In a ~1.9 ks XRT/windowed timing mode observation on 2018-11-14 (obsid: 00010955004), the source spectrum is measured to display clear signatures of obscuration, with a significant soft excess and a nominally ultra hard power-law component. Fitting the time-averaged spectrum with a model accounting for partial covering absorption, we measure pha(apec+pcfabs(po)): N_H = 0.2E22 cm^-2; kT = 0.23+/-0.03 keV; apec_norm = (5.7+/-0.1)E-3; N_H_pcf = (1.7 +0.6 -0.5)E23 cm^-2; f_pcf = 0.88 +0.07 -0.17; gamma = 2.0+\-0.4 ; po_norm = (0.85 +2.02 -0.6)E-3; chi2/nu = 24.15/27, where the errors are at the 1 sigma level. The observed 0.5 - 10 keV flux is measured to be abs_fx = (1.4 +0.1 -0.5)E-11 erg/s/cm^2. The unabsorbed 0.5 - 10.0 keV flux in the power-law component alone is unabs_fx_po = (4.1 +4.0 -1.7)E-11 erg/s/cm^2. We caution that the flux uncertainties are quoted at the 90% confidence level; however, due to the current low source flux relative to the background in wt-mode, the quoted fluxes may be systematically uncertain at the 25-30% level, i.e, abs_fx ~ 1.9E-11 erg/s/cm^2; unabs_fx_po ~ 5e-11 erg/s/cm^2 if the background is ignored. The current source properties are consistent with those observed from V404 Cyg during the 2015 outburst (e.g., Motta+ 2017, MNRAS, 468, 981) and previously from V4641 Sgr (Morningstar+ 2014, ApJ, 786, 20), and suggest that significant mass is being ejected from the inner accretion flow during the current phase of the ongoing outburst. Further multi-wavelength observations are encouraged."

The spectrum is blue, with Balmer lines showing multi-component profiles. A narrow, unresolved Halpha feature sits on a broad component (with FWHM ~11000 km/s). A broad P Cygni profile is possibly detected for Hgamma, with the minimum blue-shifted by about 6500 km/s. The redshift of the faint host galaxy is inferred from the position of the narrow Halpha.

118,ATEL #12222,"We report on the temporal analysis of NICER and Fermi/GBM observations of the new transient Swift J005139.2-721704 located in the SMC (ATel #12209, #12219) that resulted in its identification with the known X-ray pulsar XTE J0052-723 (SXP 4.78). We obtained 14.1 ksec of NICER data between 2018 November 14 at 22:11:16 UTC and 2018 November 16 at 16:20:39 UTC (ATel #12219). We analyzed the cleaned NICER event list in the 0.35-9.0 keV range. We applied a barycenter correction using the coordinates reported in ATel #12209. We computed the power spectrum (Leahy normalized) and identified a fundamental peak and its first harmonic. The fundamental peak is located at 0.20913 Hz (4.78 s). The detection significance is about 7.8 sigma. The pulse profile shape and amplitude resemble those derived from the RXTE data (Laycock et al 2003). Following the detection of a periodic signal in the NICER data we performed a dedicated search in the Fermi/GBM data. On November 11, Fermi/GBM detected coherent pulsations from the direction of the SMC with a frequency of 209.1208&plusmn;0.0013 mHz. The spin period matches that of the known RXTE pulsar SXP 4.78 nominally located at ~4&prime; distance from the transient system. We note that such a large discrepancy between RXTE/PCA-derived coordinates and the actual position of X-ray systems is not atypical for SMC pulsars. For example, SXP 2.16 was reported to have a positional uncertainty better than 4&prime; while the actual position of the system was ~16&prime; away (ATel #8305; Vasilopoulos et al. 2017). The detection of a coherent signal strongly suggests that Swift J005139.2-721704 and XTE J0052-723 are the same source (SXP 4.78), and that the spin period of the pulsar has shown little net change over the last 19 years. Furthermore, based on the improved Swift/XRT position, the optical counterpart of SXP 4.78 is very likely the B-type star [M2002] SMC 20671 recently reported in ATel #12209, and not the star [MA93]537 proposed by Laycock et al. (2003), nor the star AzV 129 suggested by Coe et al. (2005). NICER is a 0.2-12 keV X-ray telescope operating on the International Space Station.

120,ATEL #12219,"NICER observed the new transient Swift J005139.2-721704 located in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and discovered on 2018 Nov. 9 (ATel #12209). The source position identified using Swift XRT as RA=00:51:39.2 and DEC=-72:17:03.6 (with an uncertainty of 1.4&Prime;, ATel #12209). We obtained 8.6 ksec of NICER data between 2018 November 14 at 22:11:16 UTC and 2018 November 15 at 15:36:13 UTC. The average NICER count rate is 22.4 c/s (5.4 mCrab) in the 0.5-8 keV range (after background subtraction of ~0.5 c/s in that range). The spectrum can be described by an absorbed blackbody+powerlaw model in 0.5-8.0 keV range, with chi<SUP>2</SUP>=1.2 (399 d.o.f.), and with best fit parameters N<SUB>H</SUB> = (0.56&plusmn;0.04) &times;10<SUP>22</SUP>cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, kT = 0.120&plusmn;0.005 keV and a powerlaw photon index Gamma = 1.07&plusmn;0.03 (all uncertainties are at the 90% confidence level). The flux in that energy range is 1.1&times;10<SUP>-10</SUP>erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, which corresponds to a luminosity (corrected for absorption) of L<SUB>X</SUB> ~7&times;10<SUP>37</SUP>erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, assuming a distance of 60 kpc to the SMC. A timing analysis on these initial NICER exposures finds no sign of short period coherent pulsations. However, we find significant variability (~30% fractional amplitude) on a timescale of ~600-650 seconds. The current NICER snapshots are too short for a definitive conclusion on a periodicity on such timescale, and additional observations are needed to decipher the nature of this variability. We encourage follow-up observations with other facilities.

Inserra et al 2009 (CBET 1907,  ) described the 2009 spectrum as a very blue, featureless continuum. A careful re-analysis of the 2009 spectrum confirms the blue continuum and reveals the presence of relatively weak absorption lines consistent with H-beta, H-gamma and H-delta at rest frame.

125,ATEL #12214,"We report on the NIR brightening of the low redshift QSO PKS2233-148 (z=0.325). 0n October 29th,2018 MJD(2458420.68199), we found the source with NIR flux H = 13.209 +/- 0.06, while on MJD 2458069 the flux in the H band corresponded to H = 14.866 +/- 0.03. Hence, the source has increased its flux by a factor of 4.6 in this lapse. Our observations are carried out with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo Haro Observatory operated by the National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (Mexico), equipped with the instrument CANICA a NIR camera.

126,ATEL #12207,"In ATel #12177 we announced the discovery of the 2018 eruption of the recurrent nova M31N 2008-12a on 2018-11-06.80 UT. We reported the follow-up UV detection with Swift/UVOT in ATel #12182. M31N 2008-12a has now been detected in eruption 11 times in 11 consecutive years (cf. ATels #5607, #6527, #7964, #9848, #11116). Comprehensive multi-wavelength studies of previous eruptions were published by Darnley et al. (<a href="" "">2014</a>, <a href="" "">2015</a>, <a href="" "">2016</a>) and Henze et al. (<a href="" "">2014</a>, <a href="" "">2015a</a>, <a href="" "">2015b</a>, <a href="" "">2018</a>). For additional optical photometry and spectroscopy of the ongoing eruption see ATels #12179, #12181, #12189, #12190, #12195, #12200, #12203, #12204, #12205. Here we report the emergence of the supersoft X-ray source (SSS) phase of M31N 2008-12a. A faint X-ray counterpart was detected in a 3.9-ks Swift observation starting on 2018-11-13.02 UT. We measured the preliminary XRT count rate to be (1.1&plusmn;0.2) &times; 10<SUP>-2</SUP> ct/s (corrected for vignetting, dead time and PSF). No X-ray source was detected at a significant level in the preceding 4.7-ks Swift observation on 2018-11-12.03 UT with an 3&sigma; upper limit of 4.0 &times; 10<SUP>-3</SUP> ct/s. If we assume an eruption date of 2018-11-06.80 UT (MJD 58428.80), identical to the discovery date (ATel #12177), then the SSS counterpart appeared around day 6.2 after eruption. Taking into account the last non-detection, this preliminary estimate is well consistent with the 5.9&plusmn;0.5 days measured in 2014 (ATel #6558, Henze et al. <a href="" "">2015</a>), the 5.7&plusmn;0.5 days seen in 2015 (ATel #7984, Darnley & Henze et al. <a href="" "">2016</a>), and the 5.8 days observed for the peculiar 2016 eruption (ATel #9872, Henze et al. <a href="" "">2018</a>). Note the slightly earlier preliminary 4.7 days for the 2017 eruption (ATel #11130). In addition, the nova is still detected as an ultraviolet (UV) source with a magnitude of uvw2 = 19.5&plusmn;0.1 mag, well below the first UVOT measurement of uvw2 = 17.3&plusmn;0.1 mag (ATel #12182). Our preliminary magnitudes use the UVOT photometric system (Poole et al. <a href="" "">2008</a>, Breeveld et al. <a href="" "">2011</a>) and have not been corrected for extinction. We wish to thank the Swift Team for the excellent scheduling of the observations, in particular B. Cenko, the duty scientists, and the science planners."
127,ATEL #12208,"Following the detection of a new flaring gamma-ray source, Fermi J1153-1124 (ATel #12206), we performed a dedicated analysis at the source location (R.A., Decl. (J2000)= 178.44, -11.11 deg) using AGILE-GRID data. Integrating from 2018-11-09 00:00 UT until 2018-11-13 00:00 UT, a preliminary maximum likelihood analysis yields a detection at the level of about 5 sigma and a flux F(E>100 MeV)=(2.0 +/- 0.7) x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1, at Galactic coordinates (l, b) =(280.8, 48.5) +/- 0.6 deg (95% stat. c.l.) +/- 0.1 deg (syst.) (R.A., Decl. (J2000) = 178.1, -11.8 deg). In a longer 7-day integration, starting from 2018-11-06 00:00 UT until 2018-11-13 00:00 UT, AGILE detected the source with a preliminary significance of about 4 sigma and a flux F(E>100 MeV)=(1.2 +/- 0.4) x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1. This measurement was obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of the sky in spinning mode. The source can be monitored with the public mobile application ""AGILEScience"" developed by the AGILE Team, available for both Android and iOS devices."

Accordingly, this event would represent a time-integrated muon-neutrino flux normalization upper limit assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE) at the 90% CL of 1.67 x 10^-4 TeV cm^-2 for this observation period. The detected event, coincident with the source location within the track uncertainties for these events (~0.5 degrees), arrived at: 2018-11-11 07:41:30 UTC (MJD 58433.32048611) While this detected event does not represent a significant detection, its arrival time is of potential interest to the astronomical community.

129,ATEL #12209,"Observations from the Niels Gehrels Swift telescope on 9 and 12 November 2018 revealed a new transient X-ray source in the SMC which we identify as Swift J005139.2-721704. Previous observations of the same field on the 6 November barely detected the source. By the 12 November it had reached 0.5 counts/s in the XRT telescope. A follow-up 5ks Windows Timing measurements on 12 December did not detect any coherent pulsations. But we obtain a hard, photon index = 0.87 +/- 0.08 from the spectral fit - very similar to that obtained from the PC mode date of 0.87 +/- 0.09. The Swift WT count rates indicate an X-ray flux of 8E-11 erg/s/cm^2, corresponding to a luminosity of approximately 4E37 erg/s if the source is in the SMC. The best position of the new source is RA 00 51 39.2, Dec -72 17 03.6 with an estimated uncertainty of 1.4 arc-seconds radius (90% confidence). This position is coincident with a V=15.6 B-type star [M2002] SMC 20671, and hence this is probably a new SMC HMXB transient system. The current Swift count rates indicate an X-ray luminosity of approximately 1E37 erg/s if the source is in the SMC. OGLE III and IV data were examined for the proposed optical counterpart, and it is noted that the star is brighter in the I-band than it has been for the past ~6000 days. This suggest the recent growth, or increase in size, of a circumstellar disk feeding the X-ray outburst. Timing analysis of the OGLE data did not reveal any periodic behaviour in the 2 to 100 day range. X-ray and optical observations of the field are scheduled to follow this outburst over the next few weeks."

131,ATEL #12206,"The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, has observed enhanced gamma-ray emission from a source (Fermi J1153-1124) with coordinates R.A. = 178.44 deg, Decl. = -11.11 deg (J2000) and 95% confidence error radius of 0.22 deg. Fermi J1153-1124 is not in any published LAT catalog and was not detected by AGILE or EGRET. The error circle contains a flat spectrum radio quasar, PKS J1153-1105, located at z=0.269, which is also a VLBI calibrator. Preliminary analysis indicates that Fermi J1153-1124 went into a high flux state on November 10, 2018, and further brightened on November 11, 2018 reaching a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (1.0+/-0.2) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 with a single power-law photon index of 2.34+/-0.12 (statistical uncertainty only). Because this is a new detection of this source, we strongly encourage further multifrequency observations of this object. Since Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring of this source will continue. Fermi J1153-1124 is being added to the ""LAT Monitored Sources"" and consequently a preliminary estimation of the daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi-LAT will be publicly available ( ).

134,ATEL #12197,"We report on simultaneous multi-colour optical observations of the new X-ray transient Swift J1858.6-0814, first discovered by Swift/BAT on 2018 October 31 22:53 UT (ATel #12151). This source has been found to display significant variability, with flaring on timescales of seconds in both X-rays and Optical (ATel #12158, #12163, #12164, #12186). The nature of the source remains unclear, with both neutron star and black hole compact object scenarios suggested (ATel #12158, #12180). Variable radio emission supports the presence of a jet (ATel #12184). The Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia Collaboration, 2018, A&A 616, A1) does not show any source with a measured parallax within a search radius of 2 arcseconds around the coordinates reported in ATel #12160. Our observations were carried out with the fast triple-beam camera ULTRACAM on the ESO/NTT (Dhillon et al. 2007, MNRAS, 378, 825) on 2018 November 09, from 00:30-01:18 UT, for a total duration of ~48 minutes. u<span>'<span>, g<span>'<span> and i<span>'<span> bands were observed simultaneously, and we achieved a cycle time of 0.92 s in g<span>'<span> and and i<span>'<span>. Up to 5 co-adds were used in u<span>'<span> to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The median signal-to-noise per frame was 15, 31 and 24 in u<span>'<span>, g<span>'<span> and i<span>'</span>, respectively. Target counts were corrected with a simultaneously observed bright comparison star. The source exhibits stronger variability in the blue on timescales of minutes, with rises and dips in flux by factors of ~2-5 (see link at the bottom). The fractional variability amplitude (Vaughan et al. 2003, MNRAS 345, 1271) was found to be ~0.42, ~0.34 and ~0.27 for u<span>'<span>, g<span>'<span> and i<span>'</span>, respectively. Additionally, sporadic, short flares are seen down to timescales of seconds. Similar single-filter fast optical flares were also reported in ATel #12186 from data with a time resolution of 7 s. We find these flares to be faster (<~5 s) and their colour to be significantly red. Although the duration of our observation is relatively short, these multicomponent timing characteristics are reminiscent of those seen in the black hole X-ray binary V404 Cyg, which showed slow bluer-when-brighter oscillations as well as fast red sporadic flaring during its 2015 outburst (e.g. Kimura et al. 2016, Nature 529, 54; Gandhi et al. 2016, MNRAS 459, 554). Similarities to V404 Cyg have already been suggested in X-rays (ATel #12158). We highly encourage further observations to better sample and characterise both the fast flares and the slower oscillations. In V404 Cyg, the rapid red flaring was seen to strengthen near the peak of the outburst (Gandhi et al. 2016). We also encourage rapid, simultaneous multiwavelength observations to search for sub-second optical/infrared delays with respect to X-rays, which would test the origin of the variations seen here. Ground-based optical/infrared visibility of the source is worsening, so quick turnaround is important. ULTRACAM light curve segment of Swift J1858.6-0814:  "

138,ATEL #12198,"We report a spectroscopic observation of the optical transient ASASSN-18zj (as known as AT 2018hyz) performed on Nov. 9, 2018 UT with the Kast spectrograph mounted on the 3-m Shane telescope at Lick Observatory. ASASSN-18zj (RA 10:06:50.875; Dec +01:41:33.96) was discovered by the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN; Shappee et al. 2014; ATel #12194) on 2018-11-06.65 at g = 16.4 mag. According to ATel #12194, the position of ASASSN-18zj is within ~0.1” of the center of its host galaxy 2MASS J10065085+0141342 (redshift z = 0.045815, via NED), and its luminosity was approximately M_g = -20.2 mag at the time of discovery. The Lick/Kast spectrum reveals a blue continuum with a broad (~10,000 km/s) H-alpha emission line and also weaker broad emission lines of (probably) H-beta and He I 5876 Angstrom (rest wavelength). SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows good matches with young Type II supernovae. The spectroscopic features are also similar to those of optical tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates such as ASASSN-14ae (Holoien et al. 2014). The SDSS archival spectrum of the host galaxy shows clear signatures of an E+A/post-starburst galaxy with the presence of H-alpha absorption and other strong Balmer absorption lines, including H-delta. Optical TDE candidates are known to have a clear preference for E+A/post-starburst galaxies (Arcavi et al. 2014; French et al. 2017). The transient's spectroscopic features, high luminosity, and location (consistent with the host-galaxy center), together with the E+A host, make ASASSN-18zj an excellent TDE candidate. Multiwavelength follow-up observations are strongly encouraged."

It shows a blue continuum and P Cygni H lines with a multi-component profile. The Balmer lines have a relatively broad P Cygni component, with a minimum blue-shifted by 4400-4600 km/s, and a more prominent emission component, with FWHM ~ 3900-4100 km/s. Prominent, unresolved narrow emission lines are superimposed to the broad components, that can be due either to SN circumstellar medium, or unrelated foreground host galaxy gas. [O III] and [S II] lines are in fact also identified in the spectrum. The redshift of the host galaxy, IC 2327, is taken from Falco et al. 1999, PASP, 111, 438.<br/> (2) The field of AT 2018hwp was imaged on Nov. 8.30 UT, and from a comparison with available Skymapper images (ATel #5480), no new source is visible in the acquisition image. The redshift of the host galaxy, ESO 354-G29, is from Cappi et al. 1998, AJ, 115, 2250.<br/> (3) SN 2018hyw was originally discovered by the MASTER survey (see  ; Lipunov et al. 2004, AN, 325, 580), and labelled MASTER OT J082017.38+205232.2 (ATel #12038). The object was reobserved on Nov, 11.50 by SNHunt and the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (with survey name SNHunt396), that also posted their observation in TNS. The object was classified by ATel #12133 as an evolved (+41 d) Type IIb event. A spectrum of SN 2018hyw has been obtained by ePESSTO on Nov 8.37 UT, showing broad P Cygni lines of Fe II, Na I, and Ca II. However, the strongest line is Halpha, which is much more prominent than usually observed in type IIb SNe at about two months after the explosion. The ejecta velocity is unusually high for a late Type II SN. From the wavelengths of the Halpha and Na ID mimima, we find about 9000 km/s and 7900 kms, respectively. While He I 5876 can be blended with Na ID and He I 6678 with Halpha, there is no evidence for the presence of the relatively unblended He I 7065. The redshift of the host galaxy, UGC 4344, is from Schneider et al. 1990, ApJS, 72, 245."

146,ATEL #12180,"We report on optical observations of the newly discovered transient source Swift J1858.6-0814 (first detected by the BAT instrument of the Swift satellite on October 25th, 2018; ATel#12151). The source was observed in the r'-band using the the 2-metre Faulkes Telescope North on November 6th, 2018. We obtained a series of 50 30-seconds integration images. The target is well detected in all images at a position consistent with the Pan-STARRS position of a previous known object (ID 98112846453925483), as also reported in Vasilopoulos et al. 2018 (ATel#12164). The source is found to be highly variable in our ~40 mins observation, with a fractional rms of 21 +/- 1 % on a ~45 seconds time resolution; in particular, we detect a maximum and minimum r'-band magnitude (which corresponds to a minimum and maximum flux) of 17.58 +/- 0.03 and 16.71 +/- 0.02, with a mean magnitude of 17.071 +/- 0.020 (from the fit of the light curve with a constant). This indicates that the target has slightly brightened in the optical with respect to previous observations (ATel#12164). Finally, we considered the nH estimate given in ATel #12158, which is reported to vary in the range 1.5E21 - 3E21 cm^-2 (from NICER observations). Using the relation of Foight et al. 2016 (ApJ, 826, 66), from the nH we obtained an estimate of the absorption coefficient Av (~ 0.78 +/- 0.26) and of the E(B-V) (0.168-0.335). From Green et al. 2018 (MNRAS, 478, 651; see  ), for an E(B-V) ~ 0.168 - 0.335 we could obtain an estimate of the distance of the target from the reddening-distance relation, which is found to be in the range ~ 0.6 - 6 kpc (but we caution that reddening is not constrained beyond 6 kpc). With this estimate of the distance, we constructed the optical-X-ray correlation plot to identify the nature of the compact object of the system. For the X-rays luminosity, we considered a 2-10 keV unabsorbed flux in the range of 7.3(+/-2)e-11 - 1.47(+/-0.2)e-10 erg/s/cm2 (from observations obtained with the Swift satellite on 2018 November 4th and 2nd, respectively). For the optical luminosity, we considered the r'-band magnitudes reported in ATel#12164, which were taken on November 3rd, contemporaneous with the X-ray data. From the optical - X-ray correlation plot that we could build, considering trial values of distance (1, 3, 6, 8, 24 kpc), we conclude that the compact object of the system might be either a neutron star or a black hole, depending on the actual value of the distance. In particular, if the distance is low (~1 kpc), it it is more likely to be a neutron star; instead, if the distance turns out to be higher (>3 kpc), the compact object will more likely be a black hole. We encourage multiwavelength observations, especially radio, and coordinated rapid timing data, e.g. simultaneous optical/infrared and X-ray observations. The Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) observations are part of an on-going monitoring campaign of ~ 40 low-mass X-ray binaries (Lewis et al. 2008) with LCO and the Faulkes Telescopes. This work makes use of observations from the Las Cumbres Observatory."

The magnitude estimate is preliminary, assumes the UVOT photometric system (Poole et al. <a href="" "">2008</a>, Breeveld et al. <a href="" "">2011</a>), and has not been corrected for extinction. Nothing is detected in the corresponding Swift XRT exposure. We will continue to monitor the UV and X-ray evolution of this exceptional nova. We wish to thank the Swift Team for the extremely rapid and efficient scheduling of the ToO observations, in particular B. Cenko, the duty scientists, and the science planners."

Using Superfit (Howell et al. 2005, ApJ, 634, 1190), we find a good fit to the SLSN-I PTF09cnd at 16 days before peak. We measure the redshift to be 0.062 from narrow host H and O III lines.

We performed a followup observation with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA) at the reported BAT position on 2018-11-02.57, and two additional observations on 2018-11-03.71 and 2018-11-05.55 at the later refined Swift position (ATel #12158). The observations lasted 2, 2 and 4 hours respectively and were performed at a central frequency of 15.5 GHz with a 5 GHz bandwidth. We detect a source consistent with the Swift position in all three of our images. The declination of Swift J1858.6-0814 is near the observing limit for the AMI-LA, and the synthesised beam dimensionsions are large (~85x27"" for the 4 hour observation). We notice structured noise in our images, again likely due to calibration issues at this low declination. We therefore report only approximate flux measurements from our three observations of ~300, 400 and 600 uJy, respectively. We thank the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory staff for carrying out these observations."

The observations were performed on 6th of November starting at UT11:58:20.65 in SDSS r'-band. The exposure time per frame was 7s, with a dead time of 15 ms between the frames, and a total of 70 minutes of data were obtained The target is detected in all of our frames and the position is consistent with the position previously reported in ATel#12180. The archival Pan-STARRS r'-band magnitude of the system is 19.9705. We find that the source varies between an r'-band magnitude of 18.1 and 16.3 on a timescale of a few tens of seconds. In particular, we note the detection of a very rapid flare with a total duration < 21s in which the system brightens and fades by 0.9 magnitudes.

The spectrum of ZTF18abzweee (obtained on Nov. 6.09 UT) is most likely that of a type 1 AGN, with relatively broad Balmer lines (FWHM ~ 4900 km/s), and much narrower (unresolved) [O III] 4959,5007 A features, and the classification agrees with that provided by the SDSS survey. (2) The transient in NGC 665 is not confirmed, as it was not visible in our acquisition image. The redshift of NGC 665 is from Springob et al. 2005, ApJS, 160, 149. (3) The spectrum of SN 2018htf (obtained on Nov. 6.31 UT) shows a very blue continuum (T_bb ~ 9300 K) with superposed weak and narrow P Cygni lines of the Balmer series. The redshift of the host galaxy is inferred from the wavelengths of the narrow emission lines of the transient. The transient is possibly associated with NGC 1166, whose redshift is z=0.025661 (Huchra et al. 1999, ApJS, 121, 287; via NED), close to that obtained from the transient's emission lines. In this case, the projected distance from the host would be ~8 kpc. The expansion velocity of the gas, deduced from the position of the minimum of Halpha, is about 1060 km/s. This is likely a very young Type II SN, with narrow lines being produced in surrounding, slow-moving photo-ionized circum-stellar medium. The discovery absolute magnitude is about -17.3."
156,ATEL #12176,"The AZTEC (Arizona Transient Exploration and Characterization) collaboration reports the discovery of an optical transient in PGC 2086067. The object, located at RA 08:00:05.41, Dec +36:45:18.54, was detected in three r-band images taken with the MMT telescope (+ Binospec instrument) on UT 2018 November 5.45 (MJD 2458427.5). The detection was confirmed with V and R imaging on the Kuiper 61-inch telescope (+ Mont4k imager) on UT 2018 November 6.5. Previous images of the galaxy taken by our group in 2015 and 2016 do not reveal an object at that location. The transient has an apparent magnitude of r = 20.85 mags. Using a Virgo + GA only distance modulus of 36.08 mag and a foreground extinction of A_r = 0.12 mag from NED gives an absolute magnitude of M_r = -15.3. This suggests the transient could be a lower luminosity supernova near peak, or a normal supernova some time before or after peak. Spectroscopic follow-up is encouraged for the classification of this object."

163,ATEL #12173,"We call attention to the unusual host object of a blue transient, Gaia18dcu, in the Kepler field. The object is noteworthy in having a very hot quiescent SED which we find dominates not only the UV but also the visible bandpasses, a quiescent Lbol of at least ~11x Lsun over several years, and a strong H-alpha excess in at least one quiescent epoch. Gaia reports that it has shown a historical variability of ~0.5 magnitude and a G magnitude of ~20.5. It showed an increase of ~3.5 magnitudes in the outburst detected by Gaia. Variability of ~0.5 magnitude is also seen in two catalog r band values. We performed SED fitting using catalog data. We used data from the Pan-STARRS Release 1, the Kepler INT Survey (Greiss et al. 2012, AJ, 144, 24), Gaia catalog photometry, and the GALEX NUV Survey (Olmedo et al. 2015, ApJ, 813, 100). It was detected by NEOWISE-R. We obtained additional measurements from archival GALEX FUV and Spitzer IRAC images. We fitted the visible-UV SED to a single-object blackbody. The Av was allowed to vary as a free parameter from 0.30 to 10, with the lower limit set by the 3-D extinction map of Green et al. (2018; MNRAS, 478, 651). The Teff was varied from 1000 K to 100,000 K in 100 K increments. Only a very poor fit could be obtained for the combined UV-visible-IR SED, but a good fit using UV and optical data, so we excluded IR data from the fitting except as upper limits. Comparison with the blackbody SED suggests an IR excess. Also, there is evidence of variability by a factor of several in across two epochs in the Spitzer and WISE IR photometry. The best fit was obtained for a blackbody of 50,000 +/- 2000 K with Av = 1.81 +/- 024. The fact that the Av value is much larger than expected from interstellar extinction supports the presence of an IR excess from dust. The SED and best-fit blackbody may be viewed at   and   The nearest X-ray or gamma ray source cataloged is 12.8 arcmin +/- 15 arcsec distant. Nondetection by the RASS survey places a very approximate X-ray upper limit of ~10x the GALEX FUV flux, consistent with a ~50,000 K blackbody. Based on the blackbody SED, we estimate a bolometric luminosity of 11x Lsun to 85x Lsun, where the uncertainty is reflects the Gaia distance uncertainty (1289 to 7355 pc). The Lbol is a few orders of magnitude less than expected of a 50,000 K stellar source. This along with the H-alpha excess suggests that the optical-UV emission is dominated by an accretion disk. Gaia18dcu is not in the 2MASS catalog, but from the catalog image we placed an upper limit of Ks ~18 +/- 0.5. This is roughly two magnitudes fainter than the absolute magnitude of a main sequence late M star at ~1200 pc. Thus any cool object in the system is probably not earlier than spectral type M unless it is well beyond the Gaia ~7300 pc one-sigma maximum distance. We suggest that Gaia18dcu might be a previously unknown interacting binary. Spectroscopy of this object is encouraged. This research has used the VizieR catalogue access too, CDS, Strasbourg, France.

164,ATEL #12169,"We report on recent NICER X-ray follow-up observations of the nuclear transient AT2018zf (ASASSN-18el; ATel #11391), initially classified as a Type II supernova (TNSCR #499) but which later displayed emission lines typical of broad-line AGN (Trakhtenbrot et al., in prep). The transient is spatially coincident with Seyfert galaxy 1ES 1927+654 (z=0.017), and may be evidence of an extremely rapid accretion episode. Archival observations of 1ES 1927+654 in 2011 showed an already remarkable source, which defies AGN unification models. It was optically classified as a Type-2 AGN, but showed very little X-ray obscuration (Gallo et al., 2013, MNRAS, 433, 421). The archival X-ray spectrum was described with a \Gamma~2.4 power-law, and soft excess below 1 keV. The average 0.3-10 keV flux was ~1e-11 erg/cm^2/s. The flux varied rapidly, with a fractional excess variance of 25% on timescales ranging from 10 ks down to 500 seconds. This spectrum and variability is typical of an unobscured, high Eddington-ratio Type 1 AGN. NICER began observing 1ES 1927+654 on 2018-05-22 (2.5 months after the ASAS-SN flare on 2018-03-03), and continues monitoring with 1-3 day cadence. The 0.3-10 keV flux in May was similar to archival observations (~1e-11 erg/cm^2/s), but the spectral shape had changed dramatically. Compared to archival spectra, the new spectra are extremely soft, described roughly as a 0.1 keV blackbody with very little hard X-ray emission above 2 keV. This is confirmed with an XMM-Newton DDT observation on 2018-06-05 (PI: C. Ricci). The 2-10 keV flux had decreased by ~2 orders of magnitude or more compared to the 2011 archival observations. We find little change in intrinsic absorption (N_H~4.0e20 cm^-2). The source varies rapidly on timescales from 10 ks to 500 seconds, with fractional excess variance of 35%. Then from May-July 2018, the average X-ray flux decreased by >2 orders of magnitude, with inter-day flux variability from 1e-12 to 5e-11 erg/cm^2/s in the 0.5--2 keV band (see NICER light curve in link below). Over this time, there was little evolution in spectral shape. In August, the X-ray flux began to increase again, and the source is now brighter in X-rays than in May. The source continues to exhibit inter-day flux variability by as much as an order of magnitude. The weekly mean continues to increase through 2018-10-26, accompanied by a spectral hardening inferred by an increase in the NICER soft color hardness ratio (1-2 keV / 0.4-1.0 keV).

These SCWs cover the period from 2018 October 22 at 15:04 to November 2 at 6:55 UT. We built the IBIS/ISGRI mosaic combining all the above mentioned SCWs and found that the source is detected at a significance of 9 sigma in the 20-40 keV energy band and the corresponding flux is 28+/-3 mCrab. The source is only marginally detected in the 40-80 keV energy band (5 sigma) with an estimated flux of 25+/-5 mCrab. The IBIS/ISGRI spectrum (effective exposure time 3.5 ks) could be preliminary described (reduced chi^2/d.o.f. = 1.3/8) with a power-law model. We measured a photon index of 2.2+/-0.7 and a 20-100 keV flux of 3.6E-10 erg/cm^2/s. No JEM-X data are available for the considered SCWs. No pointed observations with INTEGRAL have been already planned for Swift J1858.6-0814, but it will be serendipitously observed during similar slewing SCWs in the coming days."

167,ATEL #12166,"We report spectral observations, made on 2018 Nov 4 UT, of AT 2018htr, discovered by DLT40 in NGC 0045, with the Goodman spectrograph (wavelength range 3800 - 8950 A) on the SOAR telescope. The spectrum is blue with Balmer and He I P-Cygni features and several strong absorption features including Ca H&K and several Fe II lines. The spectrum is generically similar to ""cool"" LBV outbursts such as UGC 2773 OT-1 (Smith et al., 2010, AJ, 193, 1451; Foley et al., 2011, ApJ, 732, 32). The spectrum is also similar to the Type IIn SN 1994W (Sollerman et al., 1998, ApJ, 493, 933). Correcting for the small redshift of NGC 0045 (cz = 467 km/s; Monnier Ragaigne et al., 2003, A&A, 408, 465), we find that the minimum of the H-alpha absorption for AT 2018htr is blueshifted by -1240 km/s. The absorption feature extends to approximately -2100 km/s. We also report photometric observations, also made on 2018 Nov 4 UT, of AT2018htr with the Swope telescope (+ Direct imager). At 20181104.02 UT, we measure g = 19.4 +/- 0.1 mag, fainter than the observation made by DLT40 two days earlier (20181102.07 UT), where they report a clear magnitude of 17.5 +/- 1.1 mag. To test if AT 2018htr was fading quickly, we obtained another epoch (at 20181104.10 UT), but it has not faded significantly between the two epochs. Using a Tully-Fisher distance to NGC 0045 of 9.2 Mpc (Karachentsev et al., 2013, AJ, 145, 101) or alternatively a TRGB distance of 6.6 Mpc (Tully et al., 2013, AJ, 146, 86), we find that the transient is currently M_g = -10.5 or -9.8 mag, respectively. This is fainter than most LBV outbursts and similar to the quiescent luminosity of some LBVs. It is significantly fainter than any SN IIn, and we therefore consider AT 2018htr likely an LBV or other stellar outburst. We thank the SOAR observatory staff, particularly C. Corco, P. Ugarte, and SOAR director J. Elias for rapid execution of this ToO observation under NOAO program 2018B-0315."
168,ATEL #12163,"Following the discovery of the X-ray transient Swift J1858.6-0814 (Krimm et al. ATel #12151, also Ludlum et al. #12158 and Kennea et al. #12160), we investigated the source activity after October 9 (MJD 58400) using MAXI/GSC data. We find that the 2-10 keV X-ray flux tends to increase since around October 24 (MJD 58415), and decrease after October 30 (MJD 58421). The 1-day averaged 2-10 keV X-ray fluxes on October 24 and 29 (around the peak) were 0.009 (+0.009, - 0.008) c/s/cm2 (~ 4 mCab) and 0.017 (+0.010,-0.009) c/s/cm2 (8 mCrab), respectively. This soft X-ray fluxes lower than the hard ones Swift/BAT obtained (ATel #12151) are consistent with a very hard spectrum in the faint state when NICER (ATel #12158) and Swift/XRT (#12160) observed. MAXI/GSC also marginally detected two bright flares from the region consistent with the source position at 09:32 UT on October 27 and 02:25 on October 30. The flares have different spectral properties though the difference is not significant. The former flare has a soft spectrum, similar to flares NICER detected (ATel #12158), and average count-rates are 0.099 (+0.035,-0.029) and 0.048 (+0.029,-0.022) c/s/cm2 at 2-4 keV and 4-10 keV, respectively. While the latter has a hard spectrum having count-rates of 0.018 (+0.021,-0.014) and 0.105 (+0.041,-0.034) c/s/cm2 at 2-4 keV and 4-10 keV, respectively."

MAXI 1820+070 (= ASASSN-18ey) has been proposed to be a black hole X-ray binary by Baglio et al. (ATel #11418), following the discovery of the source by Kawamuro et al. (ATel #11399) on 2018 March 11, and is being intensively monitored worldwide over the whole range of the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g. ATel #12061, #11887, #11855, #11833, #11831, #11578, #11490). After the hard to soft transition in the X-ray band reported by Homan et al. (ATel #11820) on July 5, a reverse transition from the soft to hard state was observed starting at around September 22 (Negoro et al., ATel #12057). With a certain delay after this transition, also the optical emission of MAXI 1820+070 started to change. Baglio et al. (ATel #12128) reported a re-brightening at optical wavelengths taking place after October 5, delayed by almost two weeks from the increase in the hard X-rays and the subsequent radio detection (indicating the likely reactivation of the jet; Bright et al., ATel #12061). Here we confirm the results of Baglio et al. and provide further information on the evolution of the optical emission during October 2018. Averaging over the short time-scale periodicities displayed by the object, the mean brightness and colors of MAXI 1820+070 in our data are given in the table reported below. Following the soft to hard transition of September 22, the brightness decline became faster and the source reached a sharp minimum centered on Oct 3.8 UT, while keeping the same blue colors it had before. The recovery from this sharp minimum was accompanied by the colors becoming significantly redder, with a new maximum being reached around Oct 12.0 UT. MAXI 1820+070 then entered a smooth decline phase characterized by stable colors, redder than those in the pre-brightening phase. In our last observing run for Oct 30.8 UT, effectively marking the conclusion of the October re-brightening event, we measured a magnitude B=15.02 and colors B-V=+031, V-R=+030. The main lasting effect of the October evolutions is then a change in the optical colors from a median value of B-V=+0.16 and V-R=+0.18 before re-brightening, to B-V=+0.30 and V-R=+0.30 during and after it. <center> <table border=""1""> <tbody><tr><th>UT</th><th>HJD</th><th>B</th><th>B-V</th><th>V-R</th></tr> <tr><td>2018 Sep 22.5</td><td>8384.0</td><td>14.35</td><td>0.17</td><td>0.21</td></tr> <tr><td>2018 Oct 3.8</td><td>8395.3</td><td>14.93</td><td>0.16</td><td>0.21</td></tr> <tr><td>2018 Oct 12.0</td><td>8403.5</td><td>14.43</td><td>0.30</td><td>0.30</td></tr> <tr><td>2018 Oct 30.8</td><td>8422.3</td><td>15.02</td><td>0.31</td><td>0.30</td></tr> </tbody></table> </center>"
174,ATEL #12158,"We report on initial NICER observations of the new Galactic transient source Swift J1858.6-0814 (ATel #12151). It is unclear if the source is a black hole or a neutron star. NICER observed Swift J1858.6 on 2018-11-01, beginning at 15:52 UT, for an exposure of ~9 ks. Initial attempts to localize the source within the 3 arcmin error circle (ATel #12151)--by employing pointing coordinates offset by 1 and 2 arcminutes from the nominal position in hopes of ""peaking up"" the signal--were hampered by large count-rate fluctuations from the source; we nevertheless settled on a pointing direction 1 arcmin to the south (RA, Dec = 284.673 deg, -8.26167 deg) to acquire most of the available exposure. Uncertainty in the source position at this level can result in 5-10% errors in spectral analysis. The light curve showed prominent flaring on time scales of seconds, with one of the flares exhibiting an increase in count rate by a factor of a few hundred over a span of 15 seconds. A figure of the 0.5-10 keV light curve from our observations (1 second time resolution and with data gaps removed) can be found at the link provided below. A preliminary timing analysis did not reveal any quasi-periodic features or pulsations. Time-averaged energy spectra were extracted for three different intensity intervals, selecting COR_SAX>4, and normalized to the Crab Nebula as per Ludlam et al. 2018. The spectra could be described by the simple phenomenological model of an absorbed thermal disk and power-law component. The spectrum extracted from the highest intensity interval (>100 cts/s) had an exposure time of ~290 seconds at an absorbed 0.5-10 keV flux of ~6.5E-10 ergs/cm2/s. The column density was measured to be nH~3E21 cm^-2, the disk temperature approximately 0.29 keV, and the photon index Gamma was ~1.2. The spectrum extracted at intermediate intensity (20-100 cts/s) had an exposure time of ~714 seconds and an absorbed flux of ~2.2E-10 ergs/cm2/s in the 0.5-10 keV band. We found a column density of nH~2E21 cm^-2, a disk temperature of kT~ 0.17 keV, and a photon index Gamma~1. The lowest intensity interval (<20 cts/s) had an exposure time of 5.6 ks, was incredibly hard (Gamma<1), and had an absorbed flux of 2.6E-11 ergs/cm2/s when the absorption column was fixed at 1.5E21 cm^-2. The source exhibits both Fe K and Fe L reflection features. The large amplitude flaring in the light curve, hard spectrum, and prominent reflection features resemble the behavior of the Galactic microquasars V4641 Sgr and V404 Cyg (see, e.g., Figure 1 in Wijnands & van der Klis 2000 and Rodriguez et. al. 2015, respectively).

175,ATEL #12160,"Swift performed a target of opportunity observation of Swift J1858.6-0814 (Krimm et al. ATEL #12151) starting on Nov 2nd at 14:30UT. A 1ks exposure in Photon Counting mode was taken. We find a previously uncatalogued point source at the following position, RA/Dec = 284.64565, -8.23789, which is equivalent to: RA(J200) = 18h 58m 34.96s, Dec(J2000) = -08d 14' 16.4'', with an estimated error of 2.2 arc-seconds radius (90% confidence). The PC mode data, corrected for pile-up, show a hard spectrum, with a photon index of 0.22 +/-0.23, with absorption consistent with the Galactic value. The PC mode light curve shows significant flaring over the short exposure, as previously reported by NICER observations (Ludlam et al., ATEL #12158). The XRT position is consistent with stars in the UKIDSS-DR5 and Pan-STARRS PS1 catalogs. The star, designated UGPS J185834.91-081414.8 in the UKIDSS-DR5 catalog, has a J-band magnitude of 18.5. In UVOT data, taken in three UV filters, a point source was detected at a position consistent with the XRT position, RA/Dec = 284.64549, -8.23775, equivalent to: RA(J2000) = 18h 58m 34.9s Dec(J2000) = -8d 14' 15.89'' This position lies 0.74 arc-seconds from the center of the XRT error region. The UVOT measured magnitudes are uvw1 = 16.87 +/- 0.20 (stat) +/- 0.03 (sys), uvm2 = 16.32 +/- 0.16 (stat) +/- 0.03 (sys), uvw2 = 17.38 +/- 0.05 (stat) +/- 0.03 (sys) in the Vega system.

Information on the object was taken from the IAU TNS list (see  ) . <br/> The observations was performed on the ESO New Technology Telescope at La Silla on 2018 November 2.11 (avg.

P Cygni lines of O I and Ca II are also observed. The ejecta velocity, obtained from the position of the minimum of Halpha, is about 1250 km/s. The general description of the spectrum agrees with that reported by ATel #12155. The spectra may resemble those of a young nova event, most likely a classical Fe nova. However, the ejecta velocities are quite modest, and the current absolute magnitude of the transient, M(r) ~ -9.7 mag obtained assuming a host galaxy distance of 3 Mpc, would pose the object in luminous tail of nova distribution. Its high luminosity combined with a modest line velocity indicate this is a non-standard event (Payne-Gaposchkin 1957). Other types of eruptive variables are still possible. A recurrent nova similar to T Pyx has also been proposed in ATel #12155, but that nova was fainter, and the early spectra showed He lines. Alternatively, the spectrum and the absolute magnitude of AT 2018hrg are also consistent with those of a very early luminous red nova or even an LBV outburst (e.g. Smith et al.2011, MNRAS, 415, 773). However, the S0 host galaxy type and the lack of luminous stellar counterparts in archive HST images make the latter scenario less plausible. Finally, we cannot even rule out a transient of the Galactic halo projected towards NGC 404. Further observations to clarify the nature of this object are encouraged. <br />"

The spectrum is consistent with a type IIP supernova at a few days before maximum. Cross correlation with a library of supernova spectra using the ""Supernova Identification"" code (SNID; Blondin and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows that it matched SN 1999em at about t=-4 days before the maximum light. After correcting for a redshift of 0.037 for its host galaxy SDSS J083337.65+553532.1, an expansion velocity of about 17000 km/s can be derived from the absorption minium of Ha line, which is unusually high for a SN IIP at this phase."

We obtained a 30 s low resolution spectrum of the source with the Goodman spectrograph on the SOAR telescope on 2018-10-23.03 UT. The spectrum is dominated by emission lines of H I, Fe II, Al II, Na I, Si II, and O I (see below a full list of the line identification). We measure a FWHM of ~2800 &plusmn; 100 km/s (for Halpha). No P Cygni profiles were detected. The spectrum is that of a classical nova from the Fe II (broad) spectroscopic class, possibly in the transition phase. The FWHM of Halpha indicates high ejection velocity consistent with the fast evolution of the light-curve. Further spectroscopic follow-up are required to track the evolution of the nova, but this source is approaching solar conjunction.

195,ATEL #12139,"V-band observations by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN; Shappee et al. 2014, ApJ, 788, 48; Kochanek et al. 2017, PASP, 129, 104502) show that the cataclysmic variable WX Arietis (hereinafter, WX Ari) faded by ~0.3 magnitudes at some point during its solar conjunction in 2018 and then by another ~0.3 magnitudes in early-to-mid August 2018. Since then, it has remained stable near V~15.3, consistent with a drop in the binary's mass-transfer rate. A well-known member of the SW Sextantis class of cataclysmic variables, WX Ari is an eclipsing novalike system and is normally characterized by a high mass-transfer rate (see D. W. Hoard's ""Big List of SW Sextantis Stars"" at  ; Hoard et al. 2003, AJ, 126, 2473). To assess the notability of the current fading episode, we retrieved the long-term light curve of WX Ari from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS; Drake et al. 2009, ApJ, 696, 870) and combined it with the ASAS-SN V-band light curve, obtaining a baseline of observations that extends back to 2005. In addition to showing that WX Ari spends most of its time near V~14.7, the combined light curve contains three low states: a pair of extremely faint states with a maximum depth of over 2.5 mag, and a partially observed low state in 2005 that was only 0.5 mag deep. The two extremely low states, which lasted from 2012-2013 and 2013-2016, were separated by a temporary bright state during which WX Ari returned to its typical luminosity. It is unclear whether the ongoing fade is simply a shallow low state (similar to the 2005 event) or a prelude to an extremely faint state, but continued ASAS-SN observations should provide the answer. The linked figure is a two-page PDF containing (1) the combined ASAS-SN/CRTS light curve and (2) the ASAS-SN V- and g-band light curve from 2018 only. The large gap in the latter is due to solar conjunction. The Notre Dame Pre-College Summer Scholars Astronomy Program made possible K.H.'s involvement with this work. Figure: WX Ari light curves:  "

There is a source in VIZIER database within an error circle radius of 0.5 arcsec. The brightness of the counterpart in USNO B1.0 catalog is R1=19.93 mag. The multi wavelength photometry observations were performed with 0.6m GWAC_F60B telescope 65sec after the event at Xinglong observatory, operated by the National Observatories of China and the Guangxi University. The brightness of this optical transient is about 14.4 mag in R band during the observation epoch and has a variation of about 0.4 mag. All these magnitudes are calibrated by the nearby USNO B1.0 magnitudes. The spectrum of the transient was obtained by the 2.16m telescope of Xinglong observatory, National Astronomical Observatories, CAS, on 2018-10-17. The beginning time of the spectrum was 16:35:13UT. The exposure time was 30 min. The OMR spectrograph was used in the observation. The spectral resolution is ~10A, and is blazed at 6000A. The transient shows a very blue continuum superposed by evident Ha, Hb, and HeII4686A emission lines. The Ha emission line is double peaked.

Preliminary analysis indicates that the source on October 18, 2018 showed a significantly increased daily average gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (2.8+/0.3) x10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1 (errors are statistical only), more than a factor of 4 greater than the average flux reported in the Third Fermi LAT catalog (3FGL). It was detected also on October 19 with an average flux of of (1.7+/-0.3) x10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1. This source is one of the ""LAT Monitored Sources"" and consequently a preliminary estimation of the daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi-LAT is publicly available (link:   ). PKS 1830-211 (z=2.507, Lovell et al. 1998, ApJ, 508, L51) is a flat spectrum radio quasar located behind the southern Galactic Bulge with gravitational magnification and absorption features. It is gravitationally lensed by a galaxy at z=0.886 (Wiklind & Combes 1996, Nature, 379, 11). It showed bright GeV gamma-ray flares detected by the LAT in October 2010 (ATel #2943 ), June 2012 (ATel #4158) and in July 2014 (ATel #6361). A gamma-ray flare was also detected by AGILE in October 2009 (ATel #2242). Since Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring of this source will continue. In consideration of the ongoing activity of this source we encourage multi-wavelength observations. For this source the Fermi-LAT contact person is S. Ciprini (stefano.ciprini@asdc.asi.it). The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.

Later spectra indeed show typical Type IIP SN features but the narrower lines allow a better redshift determination at z=0.025. This redshift puts the light curve peak at an absolute magnitude of ~-19, which is atypically high for Type IIP SNe. We find an expansion velocity of 8000 km/s for H-alpha (from the minimum of the P-Cygni absorption trough) at >200 days post discovery, which is also atypically high for a Type IIP SN at that stage. Superfit (<a href="" "">Howell et al. 2005, ApJ, 634, 1190</a>) finds matches to this H-alpha velocity with Type IIP SNe just 15-20 days post explosion. In addition, the light curve declined from a broad peak or plateau but ~50 days ago seems to have flattened and started rising again. All of these characteristics, together with a faint host galaxy, are similar to what was seen for the very peculiar supernova iPTF14hls (<a href="" "">Arcavi et al. 2017, Nature, 551, 210</a>).

Integrating from 2018-10-16 22:49 UT to 2018-08-17 22:49 UT, a maximum likelihood analysis yields a detection at a significance level of about 5.5 sigma, and a flux F = (1.1 +/- 0.4) x 10^-5 ph/cm^2/s (E > 100 MeV). This is greater of a factor 5 than the average flux (2.2 +/- 0.1) x 10^-6 ph/cm^2/s (E > 100 MeV) reported in the First AGILE catalog. The AGILE-GRID detection was obtained while AGILE is observing in spinning mode, surveying a large fraction of the sky each day.

208,ATEL #12128,"We report on optical observations of the transient black hole binary (BHB) candidate MAXI J1820+070 (ASASSN-18ey), in outburst since March 2018 (ATel #11399, #11400). Since the outburst started, we have been monitoring the field of the target in the optical using the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) 1- and 2-m telescopes (g', r', i', y bands), and with the Meade LX850 16-inch (41-cm) telescope of the Al Sadeem Observatory (UAE), using the 'blue', 'green' and 'red' Baader LRGB CCD-Filters (that approximately correspond to the central wavelengths of the g', V and R filters, respectively). The optical counterpart was always well detected, allowing us to follow the evolution of the outburst at these wavelenghts, and to compare it to the X-rays (see ATel #11418, #11533). After the detection of the hard-to soft transition in the X-rays (MJD 58300; ATel #11820), the optical fluxes followed a decreasing trend with time, similarly to what is observed in the soft X-rays. Around September 22nd (MJD 58383), a significant increase in the hard X-rays has been reported by the MAXI team (ATel #12057), suggesting for a transition to the hard-intermediate state (see also ATel #12064). After the transition, MAXI J1820+070 was detected in the radio on MJD 58384 by the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA; Atel #12061), with an integrated flux of 910+/-70 uJy. This radio detection is a clear indication that the jet has reactivated in the radio at the passage from the soft to hard-intermediate state. At the time of the radio detection, the optical fluxes that we obtained from our monitoring kept on decreasing, reaching the minimum flux on MJD 58396 (a delay in the optical flux rise with respect to the radio due to the reactivation of the jet is typically observed in BHBs; see Kalemci et al. 2013, ApJ, 779, 95). We report here the corresponding magnitudes of the target, obtained with the LCO 1-m telescope, calibrated against a group of PanStarrs bright stars in the field: g'=14.62 +/- 0.01 i'=14.55 +/- 0.05 r'=14.64 +/- 0.02 y=14.57 +/- 0.04 The first signs of the reactivation of the jet at optical frequencies happened to be on October 12th (MJD 58403). Here follow the magnitudes (Al Sadeem Telescope) on that epoch, showing the increase of the flux: R = 14.08+/- 0.03 g' = 14.16 +/- 0.02 Here also follow the AB magnitudes of MAXI J1820+070 obtained with the LCO two days later, on MJD 58405 (October 14th), that are still consistent with a rise of the optical flux: g'=14.17 +/- 0.01 i'=13.94 +/- 0.04 r'=14.06 +/- 0.02 y=13.72 +/- 0.03 Besides the increased optical flux, we also notice that the color of the source has changed, with the spectrum becoming more red. This is a strong evidence of the reactivation of the jet also at optical frequencies. Our last Al Sadeem Observatory observations, moreover, are consistent with a flattening of the light curves, with the following measured magnitudes: R = 13.86+/- 0.02 g' = 14.19 +/- 0.04 This suggests that the flux is now peaking and may start to decay. Further multiwavelength observations are strongly encouraged to confirm the peak and decay of the optical flux."
209,ATEL #12129,"The Swift/BAT team have examined the BAT data record around the time of the flare of FSRQ SDSS J002829.81+200026.7, reported by Sun et al. (ATel #12120). We find that the flux increase reported is most likely due a known instrumental effect of electronic noise (hot pixels), which caused an increase in BAT's gross count rate. On-board processing shows no detection of any activity at the reported location, either at the reported time or earlier in the mission. We therefore conclude that the reported flare is very likely not of astrophysical origin."

215,ATEL #12120,"With the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN), the flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) SDSSJ002829.81+200026.7 (z=1.552007; Alam et al. 2015) was optically detected on 2018 October 3-6 in a rapid, unprecedented factor ~100 outburst (Stanek et al. ATel #12082). Fermi-LAT reported that this source was in a gamma-ray high state during October 3-5, 2018 (Buson et al. ATel #12084), with a peak gamma-ray flux on October 4. Swift/XRT observations in October 8-9 have shown the source was under a decay in soft X-rays(Komossa et al. ATel #12094). We have investigated the observations in the same period by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board Neil Gehrels Swift observatory. We found BAT had also observed a extreme hard X-ray (15-150 keV) flare from a source coincident with the position of SDSS J002829.81+200026.7 at (R.A., Dec) = (7.124 deg, -20.007 deg)(J2000). The BAT peak flux of the flare was 13.3 +- 0.2 Crab (14.0-194.9 keV, 1 sigma error) on 2018-10-05.59265 UT. The rise of the bright hard X-ray flare was extremely rapid. The flux increased by a factor of 9.7 in about 280 seconds, and then decreased by a factor of 31 in < 4300 seconds. In the period between the BAT observation of the apparent flare peak and the following BAT survey observations, the source was outside the field of view of BAT. The entire duration of the hard X-ray flare is thus estimated shorter than about 76 minutes. Such a bright hard X-ray flare and its fast rise and rapid decay, are very rare for flares seen in quasars. The hard X-ray flare is probably associated with some violent jet activities, which deserves further multi-wavelength and multi-messenger investigations. We would like to mention that the source is also known as TXS 0025+197 (Douglas et al. 1996 AJ, 111.1945D). We thank the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory for kindly providing the data to the public."

We searched for optical flickering variability on time-scale of minutes with the 50/70 Schmidt telescope of the Rozhen NAO on October 8, 2018.

We do not detect optical flickering (see Fig. 1). The upper limit of the amplitude is 0.02 mag (20 mmag). Probably, the accretion disc around the white dwarf is very hot and the flickering is visible only in the UV, but not in the optical bands yet. Another explanation could be the different sites of origin and/or different mechanisms for the flickering activity in the UV and the optical bands.

Without assumptions on the source constancy, we obtain a rectangular error box for the transient source with the following corners: (R.A., Dec) = (265.477, -28.919) deg = (17 41 54, -28 55 08) (J2000) (R.A., Dec) = (264.748, -29.359) deg = (17 38 59, -29 21 32) (J2000) (R.A., Dec) = (265.706, -30.556) deg = (17 42 49, -30 33 21) (J2000) (R.A., Dec) = (266.439, -30.110) deg = (17 45 45, -30 06 35) (J2000) There was no significant excess flux in the previous transit at UT 15:45 and in the next transit at 18:50 UT with an upper limit of 20 mCrab for each. Because of the Galactic center region, there are a number of sources inside the error box. Our bright and transient X-ray source catalogue (see Negoro et al. 2016, PASJ, 68, S1 in detail) contains three sources in the error box, the black hole candidate 1E 1740.7-2942 (laying 0.26 deg from the above source position), the dim X-ray transient Swift J174444.9-295042 (0.40 deg; see Bandyopadhyay et al. ATel #4111), and the possible black hole transient EXS 1737.9-2952 (0.40 deg; Durouchoux et al. 1998, ApJ 507, 781). If this transient activity is really an X-ray burst (see below), it may be suggested that Swift J1744 is a neutron star and gave rise to this burst. We, however, tentatively name the source MAXI J1724-298 until the identification. Preliminary spectral analysis shows the GSC spectrum of this event can be represented by an absorbed blackbody model with a temperature of 1.6 +/- 0.4 keV and a column density nH of (1.8 +/- 1.6)e22 atoms/cm^2. The absorbed and unabsorbed 2-10 keV fluxes are 5.4e-9 erg/cm^2/s and 1.1e-8 erg/cm^2/s, respectively. Thus, the spectrum is a typical spectrum of X-ray bursts. Significant time variations were, however, not recognized during the scan transit for about 100 sec. This may indicate that we observed a tail of a relatively long X-ray burst. The upper limit of the source distance calculating the above flux on the assumption of the Eddington luminosity of a neutron star with 1.4 solar mass is 10.2 kpc. Followup observations are encouraged. Information on MAXI J1742-298:  "

221,ATEL #12111,"Our latest observations carried out with the CCD photometer of 1-meter reflector of SAO RAS allow us to conclude about a new active phase of the blazar [hb89]0234+285 also known as the radio and gamma source (4C+28.07 and 3FGLJ0237.9+2848, respectively). Its last activity period in the IR range was noticed by Carrasco et al. (Atel #11261) in the last February. All the data obtained in every night since October, 6 till October, 13 indicate the brightness of the source in the range between 14m.0 and 14m.5 in the R band. Usually, blazar's brightness is about 17m (R-band). The maximum brightness of [hb89]0234+285 was detected in October, 9 and even exceeded 14m (13.95m at MJD=58401.5868). Hence, the source has increased its flux by a factor of 3 magnitudes with respect to its quiet state. We should note also that the blazar demonstrated the significant intra-day variability too: its flux changed within the 0m.25 range in course of our 3--4 hour studies on October, 9 and 11, respectively. Latest measurements have showed that [hb89]0234+285 has become fainter---now its flux is decreasing to R=14m.7. All the magnitudes were calibrated using standard stars from the PG0220+132 field of Landolt (1992, AJ 104, p.340). We shall continue studying the source in following nights.

235,ATEL #12092,"We report on the observations of the X-ray outbursts from two Be/X-ray binary pulsars triggered by the MAXI/GSC nova-alert system (Negoro et al. 2016, PASJ, 68, S1). The X-ray brightening of A 0535+26 was triggered on 2018-09-22 (MJD 58383). According to the 4-10 keV data extracted from the MAXI/GSC On-demand system with the modified background region, the present outburst started from 2018-09-20 (MJD 58381), and the flux reached 0.0473 +- 0.0170 ph/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (41 +- 15 mCrab) on 2018-09-24 (MJD 58385). The onset date of the current outburst corresponds to the orbital phase of ~0.06, which is derived from following orbital parameters, T<sub>0</sub>=44943.5(MJD), P<sub>orb</sub>=111.0 d (Giovannelli et al. 2013, A&A, 560, 1). The moderate flux increase rate in 4-10 keV energy band is comparable to that of the normal outburst in 2014 (Nakajima et al. Atel#6569). Therefore, we consider that the source again exhibited the normal outburst since the last weak X-ray outburst observed in October 2016 (Iwakiri et al. Atel#8977). Because the source region was in the out of the field of view from 2018-09-24 (MJD 58385), the outburst peak was not observed by the MAXI/GSC. Neil Gehrels Swift observatory and Fermi/GBM also detected this X-ray brightening. The 15-50 keV flux peaked at 2018-09-26 (MJD 58387), and faded on 2018-09-29 (MJD 58390). The day-averaged maximum flux was 0.0201 +/- 0.0025 counts/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (91 +/- 11 mCrab). The source light curves can be checked at the following pages; MAXI( ), Swift/BAT( ), Fermi/GBM( ), and the BeXRB monitor page( )</a>. A weak X-ray emission from GRO J1008-57 was triggered on 2018-09-30 (MJD 58391). After the trigger, the source flux in 4-10 keV band started to increase from 2018-10-04 (MJD 58395) and reached 0.1036 +- 0.0146 photons/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (89 +- 13 mCrab) on 2018-10-09 (MJD 58400). The trigger date corresponds to the orbital phase of ~0.9 (T<sub>0</sub>=54416.65 (MJD) and P<sub>orb</sub>=249.48 d (K&uuml;hnel et al. 2013). The average flux increase rate in recent days is ~0.015 photons/s/cm<sup>2</sup>/day which is twice the nominal value of the normal outburst of this source. The 15-50 keV band data observed by Swift/BAT also exhibits the high flux increase rate of ~0.008 count/s/day (average rate of ~0.002 count/s/day). Multi-wavelength observations are encouraged to monitor this source activities. The latest X-ray light-curve can be followed at the following pages: MAXI ( ), Swift/BAT ( ), Fermi/GBM ( ), and the BeXRB monitor page ( )."

237,ATEL #12094,"We have observed the flaring flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) SDSSJ002829.81+200026.7 (87GB 002553.4+194347; Gregory & Condon 1991) at redshift z=1.55 with the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory on 2018 October 09 in all filters in the optical and UV, and in the X-ray band. SDSSJ002829.81+200026.7 was detected in a rapid, unprecedented factor ~100 outburst with the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN; ATEL #12082) with peak on 2018 October 05. It is now fading, and was accompanied by a gamma-ray flare (ATEL #12084). With Swift, we detect the FSRQ at an X-ray countrate of (4.1+1.3-1.1)e-3 counts/s, marginally fainter than during an earlier Swift observation carried out on 2018 October 08 at (5.5+1.5-1.3)e-3 counts/s. Merging both observations, we estimate a rather flat X-ray spectrum with photon index Gamma_x=1.3+/-0.3 (absorption fixed at the Galactic value), and an average unabsorbed X-ray flux of 3.81e-13 erg/cm2/s in the observed (0.3-10) keV band. The X-ray position of RA-2000: 00h 28m 29.77s, Dec-2000: +20deg 00' 24.7'' (90% confidence error radius of 4.4'', based on Evans et al. 2009) is consistent with the optical SDSS position of this broad emission-line quasar. SDSSJ002829.81+200026.7 was detected in all optical/UV bands with Swift at magnitudes in the Vega system of UVW2: 19.88+/-0.20 (19.21), UVM2: 18.99+/-0.11 (18.19), UVW1: 18.96+/-0.13 (18.40), U: 18.42+/-0.12 (17.97), B: 19.21+/-0.19 (18.86), and V: 18.52+/-0.23 (18.25) (uncorrected and corrected for Galactic extinction, respectively) on 2018 October 09. This implies a decline by 0.6 mag in the filter UVW1 which was chosen during the earlier, independent Swift observation of October 08, and shows that the flare is rapidly fading in the UV as well."
238,ATEL #12095,"Preliminary Fermi LAT analysis reveals enhanced gamma-ray activity from the direction of the Crab Nebula. The daily-averaged gamma-ray fluxes (E>100 MeV) from the direction of the Crab Nebula in the past three days were 5.6 +/- 0.2 (Oct 7), 5.0 +/- 0.4 (Oct 8), and 6.4 +/- 0.5 x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1 (Oct 9). These are a factor of ~2 greater than the average gamma-ray flux of (2.71 +/- 0.02) x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1 reported in the third Fermi-LAT source catalog (Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23). The flux in the latest 6-hour interval on 2018 October 10 from 00h-04h UT was ~10 x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1. All fluxes given are the sums of the pulsar and nebular emission, and with statistical uncertainties only. Since Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring of this source will continue. This source is one of the ""LAT Monitored Sources"" and consequently a preliminary estimation of the daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi LAT is publicly available (  ). We strongly encourage further multifrequency observations of this region. For this source the Fermi LAT contact person is Rolf Buehler (rolf.buehler@desy.de). The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden."

240,ATEL #12097,"CI Cam is a transient, which had a strong outburst in the wide range of electromagnetic waves in April 1998. We have found previously that the system consists of a B4 III-V star displaying B[e] phenomenon, and a white dwarf on an eccentric orbit with the period of 19.407 days (ATel #416). Additionally, it was shown that wind emission lines of Fe II and [N II] 5754 &Aring; shifted slowly in the spectra, and this shift reversed its direction in 2007. A treatment with the Doppler effect implies the presence of a third companion in the system which passed the periastron in a close approach that time (ATel #9663). Just after this event, the brightness of the star increased gradually by 0.4 mag in the V band and reached maximum in 2013. The star stays in the active state so far. Before the 2007 event, CI Cam exhibited double-mode pulsations with the periods of 0.4152 and 0.2667 days with the full amplitudes of 0.019 and 0.017 mag in the V band, correspondingly (ATel #1381). The ratio of periods of these waves was close to 3:2, and their interaction had signs of resonance (CoAst #159, 71, 2009): the amplitude of the light change increases several times when phases of the waves coincide. To verify the presence of pulsations in active state, we performed photometric monitoring of CI Cam at the Crimean Astronomical Station of the Moscow University. The observations were carried out with the 50 cm Maksutov meniscus telescope and CCD Apogee Alta U8300 in the prime focus with the V filter four nights in row from 4 to 7 October, 2018 (JD 2458396.43 - 2458399.62). The interval of observations corresponds to the orbital phase range 0.44 - 0.61, around the white dwarf elliptical orbit apastron, when the orbital light variations are minimum. An accuracy of the observations is 0.006 mag. We found regular pulsations only in a single mode with the period of 0.4062 &plusmn; 0.0015, the moment of maximum brightness is JD 2458398.5245. The light curve is slightly asymmetric. Amplitude of pulsations is 0.030 mag. So, in the active state with the brightness increase by 0.3 mag between 2006 and 2018, the pulsation period in this mode decreased by 2.5 &#37, and amplitude increased by 60 &#37. The pulsations in the secondary mode disappeared. This phenomenon suggests that pulsations are radial, and the secondary mode was excited earlier due to a resonance. The CI Cam pulsation is a unique phenomenon among B[e] stars. It rejects the classification of this star as a sgB[e]. The light curve of CI Cam:  "

Between 2018 September 26 and October 6 it showed enhanced activity at all wavebands in comparison to its last Swift observation on 2018 June 12. On 2018 September 26, its UVOT W2 magnitude was at 14.58 +/- 0.04 (corrected for Galactic reddening, or a flux level of (1.51+/-0.04)e-11 erg/cm2/s), which is 0.25 magnitudes brighter than during its last Swift observation, and the brightest level since February 2018. Other optical/UV magnitudes on 26 September were UVM2: 14.57+/-0.04 (14.33), UVW1: 14.62+/-0.04 (14.45), U: 14.50+/-0.04 (14.37), B: 15.37+/-0.04 (15.26), V: 15.03+/-0.05 (14.95) (uncorrected and corrected for Galactic reddening, respectively).

250,ATEL #12084,"The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has observed an increasing gamma-ray flux from a source positionally coincident with SDSS J002829.81+200026.7 at RA: 00h 28m 29.8s, Dec. +20d 00m 27s (J2000); (Beasley et al. 2002 ApJS, 141, 13B). This is a flat spectrum radio quasar also known as TXS 0025+197 (Douglas et al. 1996 AJ, 111.1945D), at redshift of 1.552007 (Alam et al. 2015, ApJS, 219, 12). Preliminary analysis indicates that the source was in a high state between October 3-5, 2018. On October 4 the source reached a peak gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV) of (0.6 +/- 0.1) x 10^-6 ph/cm^2/s (statistical uncertainty only). This represents an increase by a factor of 50 over the average flux reported in the third Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL J0028.8+1951, Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23). The enhanced state was characterized by a hard spectrum, with average photon index of 1.7 +/- 0.1, significantly harder than the 3FGL average index of 2.4 +/- 0.1. During the flare the LAT detected some high-energy (>10 GeV) photons positionally consistent with this source. The source was in an optical high state during these dates as reported by ASAS-SN (Stanek et al. ATel #12082). Since Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring of this source will continue. In consideration of the ongoing activity of this source we strongly encourage multiwavelength observations. The Fermi LAT contact persons are S. Buson (sara.buson at gmail.com) and R. Angioni (angioni at mpifr-bonn.mpg.de). The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan, and Sweden."

256,ATEL #12079,"We report here on the photometric observations of the Type IIn supernova SN 2018zd (otherwise known as Gaia18anr), discovered by Koichi Itagaki and classified by Zhang et al. (ATel #11379), with the 60-cm Cassegrain reflector in Astronomical Observatory of the University of Wroclaw (Bialkow, Poland) over the period of 3 months (from April 14 2018 to July 15 2018). Observations took place during twelve photometric nights and data has been collected in four bands of the Johnson-Cousins photometric system: B, V, Rc and Ic. I observed substantial and consistent decrease in brightness in all four photometric bands, till the point where measurements became partly unreliable due to the limitations of aforementioned telescope. We found that Gaia measurements in G-band are more or less consistent with Rc band measurements over long period of time. We also found that during two nights: May 13, 2018 and May 19, 2018 a little increase in brightness may be spotted in all used photometric bands. Such an effect may be spotted also in the data taken from other nights. Taking into account the precision of Gaia18anr photometry (especially during the first month of observations), we suggest it may be a photometric manifestation of decay processes of radioactive elements.

260,ATEL #12076,"We report fitting the SED of archival photometry of counterpart of MASTER OT J155814.41-163017.1 (ATel # 12071) to the BT-NextGen set of model atmospheres (Allard et al., 2009, Phil.Trans.Royal.Ast.Soc.A, 270, 2765). Measurements flagged as being of good quality are available from Pan-STARRS and SDSS in the ugriz bandpasses. Measurements in those two data sets in comparable bandpasses are mostly within one sigma of each other. The PAN-STARRS data and SDSS data were obtained at different epochs about five years apart. The ugriz magnitudes are all ~21. In the fitting, the object temperature was allowed to vary from 1000 K to 70,000 K. The Av was allowed to vary as an independent variable from 0.1 to 5. Log g was varied from -0.5 to 6, and the metallicity was varied from -4 to 0.5. The best fit when assuming no IR excess was obtained from the following parameters: T = 50,000 +/- 968 K, Av = 1.57 +/- 0.30, log g = 2.5 +/- 0.5, and metallicity z = 0. A plot of the model fit and data is available at   Our best fit Av assuming a standard Galactic extinction law corresponds to E(B-V) ~ 0.40 to 0.60. According to the three-dimensional Galactic extinction map of Green et al. (2018; MNRAS, 478, 651), the E(B-V) in the direction of MASTER OT J155814.41-163017.1 is ~0.25 for all distances from ~250 pc to 50,000 pc. In addition, there is a slight flux excess relative to the model SED in the i and z bands. Thus the object may have a significant amount of circumstellar extinction in the line of sight. If we assume for the fitting that the i and z magnitudes are affected by some unspecified excess, the chi-square of the best fit improves from 9.6 to 5.2, and the new best fit is obtained with T = 50,000 +/- 933 K, Av = 1.57 =/- 0.27, log g = 3.5 +/- 0.48, and metallicity = 2.5.

263,ATEL #12072,"The newly discovered X-ray transient Swift J1658.2-4242 (J1658) was first detected in outburst by the BAT instrument aboard the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory on February 16, 2018. Since then, Swift performed extensive monitoring of this source from February through August of 2018 (ATel #11307, ATel #11311). We used the online tools provided by the UK Swift Science Data Centre ( ) to extract light curves and energy spectra of all Swift/XRT available observations. Light curve created using the XRT observations of J1658 showed a peak of the outburst on 02-03-2018 12:16:06 UT(MJD 58179.52) (see  ). To fit the spectrum extracted using the observation made on this date, we began with an absorbed blackbody, however, we observed some residuals indicating the presence of a high energy component. Adding a power law component to the absorbed blackbody did not improve the fit. The broadband observations made with NuSTAR and AstroSat showed the presence of high energy cut-off (ATel #11321, ATel #11375). Thereafter, we added a cut-off power law to the absorbed blackbody for fitting the XRT spectrum. As the cut-off energy is much beyond the energy band of XRT, therefore, we fixed the energy cut-off at 46 keV as observed with the AstroSat observation (ATel #11375). We obtained an N(H) = 1.1(+/-0.3) x 10^{23} cm^{-2} and a blackbody temperature of 1.22+/-0.03 keV. It was difficult to constrain the power law index, therefore, we fixed the power law index to the value obtained ~ 1.1. We obtained a Chi^2 = 753 for 652 degrees of freedom. All uncertainties are stated at a 1-sigma confidence level. We also tried to replace the blackbody component with the disk blackbody, however, we noticed the increase in the Chi^2 to 789 from 753 for 652 degrees of freedom. Using the best-fit obtained with an absorbed blackbody plus cut-off power law we estimated the absorbed flux to be 5 x 10^{-9} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} in the 0.3-10 keV band. From the XRT light curve, we notice that after this peak, the flux of J1658 showed a gradual decrease. Swift/XRT observed J1658 for the last time on 10-08-2018 08:56:37 UT (MJD 58340.37). Due to the limited statistics, we could not use the Chi^2 statistics but used W-statistics which is background subtracted Cash statistics. The spectrum was well modelled with an absorbed power law of index 1.2 +/- 0.4 with an absorption fixed to NH= 1.8 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}. The absorbed flux measured in the 0.3-10 keV band using this observation is ~ 3.5 x 10^{-11} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}. Given the flux trend, J1658 should be in quiescence. To confirm that, we requested another observation of J1658 which was done on 28-09-2018 02:50:54 UT (MJD 58389.1172, i.e. about a month after the previous Swift/XRT observation). We detected only 2 counts in a 2000 s long observation after background subtraction. We also determined upper limits on the count rate (95 per cent confidence level) using the prescription of Gehrels (1986). This turns out to be ~ 1.5e-3 c/s and using WEBPIMMS we converted this count-rate into 0.3-10 keV flux. By assuming an absorbed power law of index 1.5 and an absorption NH= 1.8 x 10^{23} cm^{-2} , we estimated a flux of ~ 2.54 x 10^{-13} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}. Assuming a source distance of 8 kpc, this observed flux translates into a 0.3-10 keV luminosity of ~ 9 x 10^{32} erg s^{-1}. This is consistent with the quiescence luminosities observed from these type of systems, and therefore conclude that the source has transitioned into quiescence.

265,ATEL #12067,"Event AT2018cow is a recently detected transient (Smartt et al. ATel #11727), associated with a galaxy CGCG 137-068 at z = 0.014. Its physical nature is debatable, with possible scenarios including the type Ic supernova (e.g., Xu et al. ATel#11740, Izzo et al. ATel#11753), an off-axis gamma-ray burst afterglow (e.g., Rivera Sandoval & Maccarone ATel#11737), a tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate mass black hole, or a magnetar (e.g., Kuin et al. 2018 ; Perley et al. 2018 ; Prentice et al. 2018 ). To enable the distinction between these models, we conducted the very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of AT2018cow using the European VLBI Network (EVN). The first-epoch 2-h pilot observation was carried out in real-time e-VLBI mode at 1.67 GHz on 2018 September 18 (project code: RY007a) employing the high-precision phase-referencing technique. The quasar J1619+2247 is used as the phase-referencing calibrator. We detected an unresolved compact source with a signal-to-noise ratio of 22. The accurate position of the brightness peak is R.A.=16h16m00.2243s, Dec.=+22d16'04.893"" (J2000; formal uncertainty ~1 mas), which is roughly in agreement with the position derived from previous 22-GHz VLBA+Effelsberg observations on 2018 July 31 (R.A. = 16h16m00.2242s, Dec.=+22d16'04.890: Bietenholz et al. ATel#11900). The total flux density is 0.9 mJy (uncertainty about 10 percent) at 1.67 GHz, more than double the reported 0.44 mJy from the latest Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) on 2018 Aug 12.71 UT in the 1390 MHz band (Nayana & Chandra ATel#11950), indicating that the source brightness is increasing. The increasing radio flux density suggests that the effect of synchrotron self-absorption at centimeter wavelengths is decreasing. The follow-up disk-based experiment using the full EVN array, with better (u,v) coverage and image quality, will be conducted on 20-21 October 2018 at C band (5 GHz). We expect to reduce the data and report the result in a timely manner.

266,ATEL #12068,"We report on recent NICER observations of the transient black hole candidate MAXI J1820+070 (ASASSN-18ey). After spending the initial part of its outburst in the hard state, MAXI J1820+070 made a rapid transition to a softer spectral state in early July (ATel #11820, #11823). NICER monitoring observations show that it remained in this softer spectral state until recently. MAXI, Swift, and radio observations (ATel #12057, #12061, #12064) indicate that the source started a transition toward a harder spectral state between Sep. 21 and 23. Despite near-daily NICER observations of the outburst, the start of this transition occurred during a 4-day gap in our coverage. Swift observations revealed non-monotonic spectral evolution, casting some doubt on whether the source was truly returning to the hard state (ATel #12064). NICER light/hardness curves and a hardness-intensity diagram (see link below) indicate that the source is still continuing its rapid transition towards the hard state, but has not yet reached the same hardness values seen during the initial hard state. An energy spectrum obtained earlier today (Sep. 28 12:41 UT, 120 s exposure) can be well modelled with a combination of absorbed disk blackbody and power-law components (similar to the Swift spectra analysed in ATel #12064). We find an nH of ~2e21 cm^-2, a disk temperature ~0.22 keV, and a power-law index of ~2.5. The 0.3-10 keV flux (unabsorbed) is 2.95e-8 erg/s/cm^2, with a power-law flux contribution of ~65%. Compared to the Swift spectra from Sep. 25, the disk temperature is lower and the power-law index higher. In terms of X-ray variability, we observe significant evolution in the rapid variability properties as well. The averaged 0.3-12 keV power spectrum (PDS) from the last ten days before the current transition shows weak power-law noise with an integrated (0.1-100 Hz) strength of ~0.5% rms. The PDS of the first observation after the transition showed much stronger (~4% rms) peaked noise around 2 Hz, with a hint of a weak QPO around 16 Hz. In the days following the 0.1-100 Hz noise increased in strength to ~11% (Sep. 28) and decreased in frequency. Note that in the 2-10 keV band (which is more comparable to the RXTE band) the rms values after the start of the transition increased from ~11% to 27%. By Sep. 28 the QPO had decreased in frequency to ~3 Hz and increased in strength as well. On Sep. 27, two (probably harmonically related) QPOs were detected at 5.73+/-0.20 Hz and 10.78+/-0.13, with Q-values of ~5-6 and strengths of ~1.5% rms (~7% in the 2-10 keV band). These are likely type-C QPOs. Combined with the position of the source in the HID and the spectral parameters listed above, the recent power spectral properties are consistent with the MAXI J1820+070 evolving through the hard-intermediate state. We strongly encourage rapid, simultaneous, multi-wavelength observations of MAXI J1820+070 as it transitions.

268,ATEL #12064,"The transient black hole candidate ASASSN-18ey/MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11820) was discovered in March 2019 by the MAXI mission when it entered the outburst phase (ATel #11399, #11400). After an extended hard-state, the source rapidly transitioned to the soft state on MJD 58300 (ATel #11820). Following the report of a rapid increase in the hard X-ray of MAXI J1820+070, observed by MAXI/GSC and reported by the MAXI team (MAXI alerts and ATel #12057), we triggered the AMI radio telescopes (ATel #12061) and Swift. We report on the first of a series of observations, taken on September 25th (T01:45:57), and on two observations taken earlier, on September 17th (17T21:23:57) and 22nd (T03:34:57), respectively. We extracted energy spectra in the 0.3-10 keV band from Swift/XRT data, and we fitted them with a absorbed powerlaw + diskbb model. The resulting best fits show a clear evolution of the spectral shape of the source. On September 17th the energy spectrum is well described by a multicolour disk blackbody with inner disk temperature (0.603 +/- 0.004)keV and a weak powerlaw tail (normalisation 0.3 +/- 0.1) with slope 1.7 +/- 0.3. On September 22nd the energy spectrum shows a disk blackbody with temperature consistent with the above, but a harder (and slightly more prominent, normalisation 0.7 +/- 0.2) powerlaw tail, with slope 1.6 +/- 0.2. On September 25th the multicolour disk blackbody showed a lower temperature of (0.481 +/- 0.008)keV and a stronger (normalisation 2.9 +/- 0.4) hard tail, with slope 1.92 +/- 0.08. These parameters are consistent with those reported in ATel #12057. The above shows that MAXI J1820+070 was still in the soft state on September 17th. However, we can refine the time of the transition to the hard-intermediate state, which likely occurred on (or shortly before) September 22nd, consistent with what reported by the MAXI team (ATel #12057), who found a spectral change between September 21st and 23rd. We note that while the source has clearly left the soft state, it might moving back and forth along the hard intermediate, as the apparent non-monotonic evolution of the hard-tail slope seems to indicate. Swift will continue monitoring this source and we encourage multi-wavelength followup observations. We thank the Swift team for the prompt scheduling of these observations (despite the inconvenient night trigger)."

270,ATEL #12066,"A rapid growth of the 6.67 GHz methanol maser in G107.298+5.639 was observed during the night September 2/3 by Irbene 16 m radio telescope. A day before the flux densities of two components at VLSR= -8.6 km/s and VLSR= -7.38 km/s were around minimal detection level ~0.8 Jy. During 17 hours both components reached ~ 5 Jy peak flux density. Extensive monitoring campaign (near continuous observation with 40 min intervals) have shown that the current G107.298+5.639 flare is unusually strong: the -7.38 km/s component reached 101 Jy peak flux density (2018 Sept 7, 21:05 UTC ) while all previously reported values did not exceed 60 Jy, the -9.26 km/s component reached 23.5 Jy and stayed close to this level from Sept 7 18:10 UTC till Sept 8 19:50 UTC, the -8.6 km/s component reached its maximum 11.5 Jy peak flux density on Sept 5, 21:45 UTC. Low intensity components also flared: the -11.01 km/s component peaked with 4.5 Jy (Sept 8, 8:20 UTC), the -15.4 km/s one peaked with 3.4 Jy (Sept 11, 21:20 UTC). The weakest -16.6 km/s component peaked first (Sept 3, 17:00 UTC). According to our observations G107.298+5.639 flare maximums in September and July are 66.4 days apart. This is less than expected from 34.4+/- 0.8 day period estimated by M. Szymczak et al. (2016). This can be a result of the glitch or monotonous period change. If the source experiences monotonous change of the period, the next methanol maser flare should be expected earlier. The maximum of methanol maser was accompanied by the minimum of the water maser emission. On August 23 water maser spectrum of the source contained 3 components at -18.65, -16.5 and -14.6 km/s and these flux densities were equal 240, 730 and 490 Jy respectively. On September 6 only one component at -14.3 km/s had 165 Jy flux density. On September 26 all 3 components come back and these flux densities are equal 240, 660 and 450 Jy respectively. Besides that the component with 77 Jy appears at -9.9 km/s and the component with 40 Jy appears at -7.1 km/s. Observations at Caucassian Mountain Observatory of Moscow state University have shown that in the period of the maximum of methanol emission brightness of the object in K infrared colour was considerably increased."
271,ATEL #12060,"The SUPERB project (Keane et al. 2018, MNRAS, 473, 116) detected a fast radio burst (FRB) on UTC 2018-09-23-04:03:38.06 with the Parkes radio telescope at 1.4 GHz. The FRB was detected in beam 01 of the 21-cm multi-beam receiver (Staveley-Smith et al. 1996, PASA, 13, 243) centred at RA: 15:10:55.4 and DEC: -14:06:10.2 with a positional uncertainty of approximately 14 arcminutes (FWHM of the Parkes beam). It is not detected in any other beam. The burst had a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) = 13 and a dispersion measure (DM) of 548(3) pc/cc which is a factor ~12 larger than the maximum dispersion measure of the Milky Way along this line of sight, 46.6 pc/cc according to the NE2001 electron density model (Cordes and Lazio 2002, astro-ph/0207156), 39.0 pc/cc according to the YMW16 electron density model (Yao et al 2017 ApJ, 835, 29). This translates to a maximum inferred redshift of z ~ 0.5 if the FRB lies along an average line of sight through the Universe (Ioka 2003 ApJ, 598, 79; Inoue 2004, MNRAS, 348, 999). FRB180923 is 20(1) ms wide and had a measured fluence and energy of 2.9(3) Jy ms and ~4.5E32 J respectively. The pulse shows a frequency-dependent scattering tail with a scattering time of 16(2) ms at 1.4 GHz. There are no pulsars reported in the ATNF pulsar catalog within 7 degrees of the burst position. The event occurred at a time of heightened radio frequency interference (RFI) and, as such, we had to perform a longer than usual verification analysis, in turn delaying the release of this alert with respect to our usual targets. In this case the detection S/N was in fact 14, higher than the optimised S/N once RFI had been excised. Immediately following the detection we performed a calibration observation and continued to monitor the field to search for any possible repetition. No repetition has been observed. The linear polarization did not exceed the S/N threshold of 3 and no rotation measure could be recovered. We encourage follow-up with other available facilities at different wavelengths and observing windows. Two plots of the burst can be found at the link below. Plots of FRB 180923:  "
272,ATEL #12062,"The IceCube Collaboration ( ) reports: IceCube has performed a search for track-like muon neutrino events arriving from the position of AT2018gep/ZTF18abukavn (Ho et al. #12030) in the time range of one day prior to the first detection to the 24th of September (2018-09-08 04:00:00 UTC to 2018-09-24 14:00:00 UTC). Three neutrino track events are found in spatial coincidence with AT2018gep during this time period with a p-value of 0.038 (1.77 sigma) with respect to an atmospheric neutrino background only hypothesis. Accordingly, these three events would represent a time-integrated muon-neutrino flux normalization upper limit assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE) at the 90% CL of 9.7 x 10^-5 TeV cm^-2 for this observation period. The detected neutrinos, consistent with the source location within the track uncertainties for these events (~2 degrees), arrived at: 2018-09-11 20:48:33 UTC (MJD 58372.867) 2018-09-19 17:19:50 UTC (MJD 58380.722) 2018-09-21 23:52:16 UTC (MJD 58382.995) While these detected neutrinos do not represent a significant detection, their arrival times are of potential interest to the astronomical community.

273,ATEL #12061,"The transient black hole candidate ASASSN-18ey/MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11820) was discovered by MAXI in March 2019, when it entered the outburst phase (Kawamura et al. ATel #11399, Denisenko et al. ATel. #11400). After an extended hard-state, the source rapidly transitioned to the soft state on MJD 58300 (Homan et al. ATel #11820). Following the report of a rapid increase in the hard X-ray of MAXI J1820+070, observed by MAXI/GSC and reported by the MAXI team (MAXI alerts and ATel #12057), we triggered the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA). We observed the position of MAXI J1820+070 at 15.5 GHz. Our observation began on 24-Sept-2018/14:16:01.6 and had a total duration of 7 hours. We used J1824+1044 and 3C 286 as the phase and absolute flux calibrator, respectively. Data analysis was carried out as described in Bright et al. ATel #11420. MAXI J1820+070 is clearly detected by AMI-LA, with an integrated flux of 910 +/- 70 uJy (uncertainties including the calibration error). The rms noise of the image was ~30 uJy. We plan on continued monitoring of this source and would like to thank the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory staff for carrying out these observations."
274,ATEL #12057,"We report on a rapid increase in the hard X-ray flux of the black hole candidate MAXI J1820+070 in outburst (Kawamura et al. ATel #11399, Denisenko et al. ATel. #11400). During the reflaring activity starting from around 2018 July 1 (MJD 58300), the source underwent a hard-to-soft transition (Homan et al. ATel #11820). Since then, the source had been in the soft state. MAXI/GSC data from 2018 September 22 (MJD 58383) show a significant increase in hard (>4 keV) X-rays. Swift/BAT data also show that the 15-50 keV X-ray flux slightly increased on September 21, and dramatically changed from 0.01 c/cm^2/sec to 0.04 c/cm^2/sec at the beginning of September 22 ( ). These suggest the source is undergoing a state transition. The count rates in both MAXI/GSC and Swift/BAT, however, peaked on September 23, and decreased again on September 24. The GSC spectra obtained on September 20-21 (before the transition) and on September 23 are well described by an absorbed disk blackbody (diskbb) plus power-law model with a fixed column density nH of 1e21 atoms/cm^2 (Shidatsu et al., ApJ, submitted). The inner disk temperature, Tin, did not change significantly from 0.53 +/- 0.01 keV to 0.53 +/- 0.02 keV, but the diskbb normalization decreased from (2.8 +/- 0.4)e4 to (1.7 +/- 0.4)e4. On the other hand, the normalization of the power-law component with a photon index fixed at 2.5 increased by a factor of more than 3 (from 1.3+/-0.2 to 4.3 +/- 0.2). We note that these parameters are provided only to show the change of the overall spectral shape, and we do not intend to show a decrease of the inner disk radius. The unabsorbed 2-20 keV flux at the transition is (0.9-1.1)e-8 erg/cm^2/sec, corresponding to the luminosity of ~1.2e37 erg/s if the source distance of 3.2 kpc (Homan et al. ATel #11576; Gandhi et al.  ) and the isotropic radiation are assumed. As a result, the bolometric luminosity at the transition is, for instance, below 1% of the Eddington luminosity for a 10 solar mass black hole. We encourage continuous multi-wavelength followup observations of this bright and interesting X-ray nova. MAXI data of MAXI J1820+070:  "

277,ATEL #12056,"We observed the field of AT2018gep/ZTF18abukavn (ATel #12030) with the Very Large Array (VLA) on 2018-09-14 UT at a central frequency of 10 GHz. The VLA was in D-configuration and the on-source integration time was 30 minutes. Data was processed using the VLA CASA Calibration Pipeline and imaged using the CASA CLEAN function, using 3C286 as the flux calibrator and J1640+3946 as the gain calibrator. We detect an unresolved source at the phase center. Fitting the source using CASA gives an integrated flux density of 91 +/- 4 uJy at RA=16:43:48.177, Dec=+41:02:42.97. With a synthesized beam major and minor FWHM of 12.4” and 9.6” respectively, this position is consistent with the position reported in ATel #12030. At z=0.033, the luminosity is 2E27 erg/s/Hz. We caution however that this flux density is also consistent with the expected radio luminosity of a star-forming galaxy, so we cannot rule out a host galaxy origin at this time. We note that the FIRST catalog has a detection limit at this position of 0.94 mJy/beam, with a map RMS of 0.137 mJy/beam. Further follow-up is planned, and we would like to thank the VLA staff for scheduling and carrying out these observations."
278,ATEL #12054,"In the framework of our EXor monitoring program dubbed EXORCISM (EXOR OptiCal and Infrared Systematic Monitoring - Antoniucci et al. 2013 PPVI, Lorenzetti et al. 2007 ApJ 665, 1182; Lorenzetti et al. 2009 ApJ 693, 1056), we recently observed V1647 Ori, an active low mass (0.8 Msun) eruptive variable in L1630 (D=400 pc), whose classification as FUor or EXor is still unclear. This is the reason why an accurate characterization of its outbursting/quiescence phases is in order. During its recent history, V1647 Ori underwent three documented outbursts of about 5 mag and 3 mag in the optical and IR bands, respectively. The 1st-one (detected on the Asiago plates) on 1966-67 (Aspin et al. 2006 AJ 132, 1298); the 2nd on 2004-06 (e.g. Acosta-Pulido et al. 2007 AJ 133, 2020 and references therein); the 3rd on 2008-2011 (e.g. Aspin 2011 AJ 142, 135 and references therein). These phases were followed by quiescence phases (Ojha et al. 2006 MNRAS 368, 825; Aspin et al. 2008 AJ 135, 423). In particular, a gradual fading has followed the last burst (Ninan et al. 2013, ApJ 778, 116). An absolute IR minimum was detected by 2MASS on 1998 Oct 7th. On 2018, Sept 3rd a deep minimum was registered by Semkov (ATEL #12012), who gives significant upper limits (R and I bands) compatible with a minimum fainter than the first drop observed on 2008 (Mosoni et al. 2013 A&A 552, 62). During the current quiescent phase, we have observed V1647 Ori on 2018 Sept 10th in the J,H, and K bands with the NICS IR camera at the 3.6m TNG Italian Telescope (La Palma, Canary Islands). Dithering was performed to cancel the nebular contribution. The following values have been obtained: J = 13.68&plusmn;0.03, H = 11.88&plusmn;0.03, and K = 9.73&plusmn;0.05. Given the short temporal distance between the optical and IR recent observations (7 days), we could consider the R/I band upper limits (ATEL #12012), as associated to the same phase. At variance with the behavior of the optical R and I bands, in the IR regime the source appears brighter (specially in the J band) than what registered during the first fading. This circumstance could be related to a rapid increase of the extinction, or, more probably, to a brightening of the source occurred within few days. Remarkably, this last interpretation puts strong constraints on the timescale of the source fluctuations."

The brightness is fading from 16.0 to 16.5 mag in R band during the observation epoch, calibrated by the nearby USNO B1.0 sources ( RA=16:43:42.9, DEC=41:02:40.9, R2mag=16.95).

The spectral resolution is about 10Ang. The transient shows a blue continuum associated with not only Ic-BL-like features around 4200 Ang and 5600 Ang, which is consistent with the report by (ATel #12047), but also a likely bump due to the Ca triplet at the red end of the spectrum."

284,ATEL #12049,"We report the redshift measurement of a recently discovered X-ray transient in Chandra observations of the James Webb Space Telescope North Ecliptic Pole Time Domain Field (JWST NEP-TDF) obtained in late July 2018. The location of the X-ray flare (RA, Dec)=(17:24:21.72, +65:48:47.3) is consistent with SDSS J172421.74+654847.5. The discovery of this X-ray flare was reported in ATel #11906. A spectrum of SDSS J172421.74+654847.5 was obtained by D. Stern using the Double Spectrograph (DBSP) on the Hale 200 inch Telescope at the Palomar Observatory on UT 2018 August 11. Two 900 s observations of the target were taken using the 1.5 arcsecs slit at the parallactic angle. The night was not photometric due to a combination of ash produced by nearby fires and high clouds. The data were processed using standard procedures and flux calibrated with observations of the white dwarf spectro-photometric standard star Wolf 1346 obtained on the same night. The spectrum quality is high enough to identify the following high signal to noise ratio emission lines: broad (FWHM~5000 km/s) MgII 2799A, narrow [OII] 3727A, and broad Hbeta 4861A. The redshift of the source measured from these emission lines is z=0.833. The source luminosity in the X-ray band is therefore Lx=1.4e^44 erg/s, assuming the flux measured from the X-ray spectra reported in ATel #11906. From the observed optical emission lines and the X-ray luminosity, we can confirm this source is an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). We plan to obtain more spectra of this AGN to search for continuum variability. A detailed analysis of the emission line profiles and widths, as well as of the various absorption lines observed in the spectrum, will be presented in future publication(s). We thank F. Harrison (PI of the Palomar night) and the (large) Palomar crew on the night of this observations: post-PhD: Murray Brightman, Gael Noirot and Joe Simon; Caltech Summer Undergraduate Research Fellows: Honghui Liu, Renata Koontz, Andrew Sosanya and Julian Sander; and friends/relatives: Karin Emmenegger, Ingrid Kocsardi, Asher Stern, Eden Stern, Wendy Herry and Alienor Bernardie."
285,ATEL #12050,"Following the reports (ATel #11957, Sanna et al. 2018, arXiv:1808.10195) that IGR J17591-2342 is an accreting millisecond pulsar in outburst, NICER has continued to monitor this source. After the initial outburst, multiple instruments observed a re-brightening that began on 2018 August 18 (MJD 58348; as reported in ATel #12004). During that re-brightening, NICER observed the count rate to increase to about 3.8 mcrab (1-10 keV) around MJD 58362, then decline more quickly to about 2.3 mcrab by MJD 58367. Since then, the source has again re-brightened to its highest flux yet, climbing to 5.4 mcrab as of MJD 58376.8 (see Figure at link below for a 60-s binned light curve of the NICER data on this source). The background contribution in this energy band is about 0.5 c/s. Note that in the 1-10 keV energy band, 1 mcrab corresponds to approximately 8 c/s in NICER. The pulsations remain strongly present after almost 60 days of outburst, with a fractional RMS amplitude of approximately 7% (1-10 keV), in the most recent data, so they have not disappeared as observed in some long outburst AMXP systems, such as SAX J1748.9-2021 (Altamirano et al. 2008, ApJL 674, 45) and HETE J1900.1-2455 (Galloway et al. 2007, ApJL 654, 73). The 1.2-10 keV energy spectrum can be described by an absorbed power-law model with a soft blackbody component. No evidence of a spectral state change has been seen. We found a photon index varying between 0.9-2.1, positively correlated with flux, across the NICER observations. At the same time, blackbody temperatures ranging between 0.7-1 keV are seen. The column density is 2-3E22 cm^-2, consistent with the values reported in Sanna et al. (2018, arXiv:1808.10195). Continued multiwavelength observations of this ongoing transient are encouraged. NICER is a 0.2-12 keV X-ray telescope operating on the International Space Station. The NICER mission and portions of the NICER science team activities are funded by NASA.

287,ATEL #12048,"During the observations in the direction of the Galactic Bulge (ATel #438) carried out from 2018 September 18 at 11:55 to 15:36 (UTC), INTEGRAL detected renewed activity from the transient neutron star low mass X-ray binary (NS LMXB) SAX J1750.8-2900. The source is detected in the IBIS/ISGRI mosaic at a flux of 23+/-3 mCrab in the 20-40 keV energy band and 29+/-4 mCrab in the 40-80 keV energy band. The source is also detected by the JEM-X telescopes. The estimated fluxes from the JEM-X mosaics are 20+/-3 mCrab in the 3-10 keV energy band and 16.0+/-9.5 mCrab in the 10-25 keV energy band. A preliminary analysis of the IBIS/ISGRI spectrum revealed that the hard X-ray emission from the source could be characterized by a power-law model with a photon index of 3.5+/-1.2 (90% c.l.). The measured 20-100 keV flux from the spectral fit is 5E-10 erg/cm^2/s (no spectral analysis of the JEM-X data has been carried out due to the calibration uncertainties affecting the near-real time data). No type-I X-ray bursts were observed in the JEM-X lightcurves extracted with a time resolution of 2 s in the 3-20 keV energy band. The most recent hard X-ray outburst from this source was announced in 2015 (ATel #8058). Further INTEGRAL observations toward the direction of the source are already planned in the coming days. Multi-wavelength observations in other energy domains are also encouraged, as well as observations to characterize the source soft X-ray emission (< 3 keV)."

297,ATEL #12037,"Following the unprecedented optical outburst (ATel #12025) and the gamma-ray flare detected by AGILE (ATel #12026) and Fermi LAT (ATel #12027) on 2018 September 9, a Swift target of opportunity observation of the flat spectrum radio quasar B2 1633+38 (also known as 4C +38 41) was performed on September 13. Swift/XRT data were taken in Photon Counting mode for a net exposure of about 1.9 ksec. The X-ray spectrum (0.3-10 keV) observed on 2018 September 13 can be fit by an absorbed power law model with an HI column density consistent with the Galactic value in the direction of the source (n_H = 1.1 x 10^20 cm^-2, Kalberla et al. 2005, A&A, 440, 775) and a photon index of 1.41+/-0.14. The net count rate observed is 0.127+/-0.010 cnt/s, corresponding to an observed 0.3-10 keV flux of (9.1+/-0.7) x10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1.The count rate and flux observed indicate a relatively high activity state in X-rays with respect e.g. to the Swift observations in 2009-2011 (Raiteri et al. 2012, A&A 545, A48). The hard photon index obtained on 2018 September 13 confirms the harder-when-brighter behavior in X-rays observed in 2011 during a previous gamma-ray flare of the source. Simultaneous Swift/UVOT observations were performed on 2018 September 13. The measured magnitudes are: V = 16.29 +/- 0.10, B = 16.65 +/- 0.07, U = 15.83 +/- 0.06, W1 = 16.10 +/- 0.08, M2 = 17.30 +/- 0.13, W2 = 17.69 +/- 0.13, in agreement with the optical magnitudes reported in ATel #12034, and confirming the high activity state of the source in optical and UV. In consideration of the ongoing activity of this source, confirmed also by the Swift observations, we encourage further multiwavelength observations. The Fermi LAT contact persons for this source are S. Ciprini (stefano.ciprini at ssdc.asi.it) and S. Buson (sara.buson at gmail.com).

ZTF18aahqkbt (AT2018bsi) is a nuclear (offset < 0.1 arcsec) transient located at: 08:15:26.62 +45:35:31.9 (J2000) 123.860919 +45.592208 (J2000) The source was first detected by the ZTF Survey on UT 2018 April 09 with r=18.19 +/- 0.03 mag. We triggered the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM) (range 350-950nm, spectral resolution R~100) mounted on the Palomar 60-in (P60) telescope (Blagorodnova et al. 2018, PASP, 130, 5003) on UT 2018 April 18 which detected a blue continuum and a broad H and He II 4686 lines, which were confirmed with our follow-up R~1000 spectra with the Discovery Channel Telescope DeVeny spectrograph on UT 2018 May 13. We triggered Swift observations taken on 2018 June 02 which detected an AB magnitude of uvw2=17.90 +/- 0.05 mag, significantly brighter than the archival AIS GALEX magnitude of NUV=19.22 mag (Bianchi et al. 2011). The source then went behind the Sun. We recently triggered a Swift observation taken on UT 2018 Sep 05 that shows that the source has faded in the UV to uvw2 = 19.30 +/- 0.10 mag as expected for a UV transient. The broad He II lines and UV-bright nature of the transient are both consistent with the classification of ZTF18aahqkbt as a tidal disruption event (nicknamed ZTF-JonSnow).

Swift/XRT observations were carried out in photon-counting mode. We analyzed the data using  . No source was detected at the position of AT2018gep. We infer a limit of 0.003 ct/s (3 sigma confidence). Assuming a Galactic column density of n(H) ~ 1.1 E20 cm^-2, a redshift of 0.033, and a power-law spectrum with photon index = 2, this count rate corresponds to an unabsorbed flux limit of ~9.8 E-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the bandpass from 0.3-10 keV. At the distance of AT2018gep this corresponds to a 0.3-10 keV luminosity L < 2.5e41 erg s^-1. ZTF is a project led by PI S. R.

303,ATEL #12033,"During the ongoing All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, <a href="" "">Shappee et al. 2014</a>), using data from the quadruple 14-cm ""Brutus"" telescope in Haleakala, Hawaii, and the quadruple 14-cm ""Leavitt"" telescope in Fort Davis, Texas, we discovered a new transient source, most likely a supernova, in the galaxy UGC 03912. ASASSN-18vc (AT 2018get) was discovered in images obtained on UT 2018-09-10.6 at V~16.5 mag. The source having only recently emerged from behind the sun, our predetection limits offer minimal constraints. We do not detect (g>16.7) the object in images taken on UT 2018-05-05.1 and before. An image obtained on 2018-09-11 confirms the discovery of the transient. This <a href= >figure</a> shows the archival DSS image of the host (left) and the confirmation image (right). The red circle has a radius of 5"" and is centered on the position of the transient in the confirmation image. The position of ASASSN-18vc is approximately 10.5"" North and 52.6"" West from the center of the galaxy UGC 03912 (z=0.004086, d=19.7 Mpc, via NED), giving an absolute V-band magnitude of approximately -15.1 (m-M=31.48, A_V=0.147).

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion, ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients), and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin of the transient.

304,ATEL #12024,"Using data from the ANTARES detector, we have performed a follow-up analysis of the recently reported single high-energy (EHE) neutrino IceCube-180908A (GCN 23214). The reconstructed origin was 40.7 degrees below the horizon for ANTARES. No up-going muon neutrino candidate events were recorded within three degrees of the IceCube event coordinates during a +/- 1h time-window centered on the IceCube event time. A search over an extended time window of +/- 1 day has also yielded no detection (52% visibility probability). This yields a preliminary 90% confidence level upper limit on the muon-neutrino fluence from a point source of 18 GeV.cm^-2 over the energy range 2.4 TeV - 2.6 PeV (the range corresponding to 5-95% of the detectable flux) for an E^-2 power-law spectrum, and 36 GeV.cm^-2 (400 GeV - 250 TeV) for an E^-2.5 spectrum. ANTARES is the largest neutrino detector installed in the Mediterranean Sea, and is primarily sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy range. At 10 TeV, the median angular resolution for muon neutrinos is below 0.5 degrees. In the range 1-100 TeV, ANTARES has a competitive sensitivity to this position in the sky."
305,ATEL #12025,"We perform optical photometric and polarimetric monitoring of a sample of gamma-bright blazars using 0.4-m LX-200 telescope (St.Petersburg) and 0.7-m AZT-8 telescope (Crimean Astrophysical Observatory), as a part of WEBT/GASP project. We report that the blazar 1633+38 reached R=15.00 in the night of 2018 September 9, TJD 58371.29. This is a brightest value during the whole time interval of our observations since 2006. R band light curve for <a href="" >1633+38</a> can be seen on our web-page. The polarization degree is on the level of 15%. We mention that this fast brightening seems to have occurred with a noticeable (~1 weak) delay after gamma-ray outburst reported by the AGILE team (see ATel#12005). Current high activity state of this blazar deserves close attention in all wavelengths."
306,ATEL #12026,"AGILE is detecting enhanced gamma-ray activity above 100 MeV from the blazar 4C +38.41 (FSRQ 1633+38), which follows the gamma-ray outburst reported by AGILE (see ATel #12005). Integrating from 2018-09-08 UT 12:58:43 to 2018-09-10 UT 12:58:43, a preliminary multi-source likelihood analysis detects a gamma-ray flux F(>100 MeV) = (3.3 +/- 0.9) x 10^-6 photons/cm^2/s at a significance level of about 5.5 sigma. We notice that this gamma-ray activity is occurring following the optical outburst reported by the WEBT/GASP (see ATEL #12025). The AGILE-GRID detection was obtained while AGILE is observing in spinning mode, surveying a large fraction of the sky each day. The source can be monitored with the public mobile application ""AGILEScience"" developed by the AGILE Team, available for both Android and iOS devices.

This is a flat spectrum radio quasar also known as B2 1633+38, OS 356 and 3EG J1635+3813, with a redshift of 1.814 (Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2008, ApJS, 175, 297). Preliminary analysis indicates that the source on September 9, 2018 was in a high state with a gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV) of (2.6 +/- 0.5) x 10^-6 photons/cm^2/s (statistical uncertainty only). During September 9, 2018, the flux has increased by a factor of 9 over the average flux reported in the third Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL J1635.2+3809, Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23). The source was in an active state during this day as reported by WEBT/GASP (Larionov et al. ATel #12025) and AGILE (Cardillo et al. Atel #12026). A flare from this source was reported previously by AGILE (Piano et al. Atel #12005). The source is included in the list of publicly monitored sources: its preliminary light curve can be found here: <a href="" "">   </a> Since Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring of this source will continue. In consideration of the ongoing activity of this source we strongly encourage multiwavelength observations. The Fermi LAT contact persons are S. Ciprini (stefano.ciprini at ssdc.asi.it) and S. Buson (sara.buson at gmail.com). The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.

309,ATEL #12029,"We report SED fitting of catalog data to the progenitor of ASASSN-18uk (AT 2018fxl) which was recently reported to be in outburst by Brimacombe et al. (ATel # 12018). The object has not been discussed in the literature apart from catalogs. Catalogs report magnitudes in U, B, V, Gaia G, R, I, Y, J, Ks, Spitzer bandpasses at 3.6, 4.5, and 5.8 microns, and WISE bandpasses at 3.35 and 4.6 microns along with WISE upper limits at 12 and 22 microns. We fitted the SED from the catalog magnitudes to the BT-NextGen set of stellar models (Allard et al. 2012, IAUS, 282, 235). We allowed Av to vary as a free parameter from 0.1 to 1, the temperature to vary from 800 K to 10,000 K, the log g to vary from -0.5 to 6, and the metallicity to vary from -4 to 0.5. We also used the Gaia catalog estimated distance (~7200 +/- 1300 pc). A good fit was obtained using a star having the following parameters: Teff = 4150 +/- 150 K, Av = 0.195, log g = 0.5, and metallicity = -1.4 +/- 0.40. It is seen that there is no infrared excess in the near-IR, while the upper limits at longer wavelengths provide a weak limit on any strong IR excess in that regime.

316,ATEL #12017,"We conducted spectroscopic observations of AT 2018fsy (see <a href="" "">TNS</a>, a nova candidate in M31, using the SPRAT instrument (<a href="" "">Piascik et al. 2014</a>) on the 2m-robotic Liverpool Telescope (LT; <a href="" "">Steele et al. 2004</a>). Each spectral observation is preceded by a series of (typically at least 3) 10s acquisition images taken either by SPRAT (unfiltered) or <a href="" "">IO:O</a> through a Sloan-<it>r'</it> filter. This spectrum consisted of 3&times;600s of exposure time using the blue-optimised mode of SPRAT. The spectrum of AT 2018fsy shows a blue continuum punctuated with Balmer lines (H&alpha;-H&delta;), Na I-D, and possibly Fe II (42) and O I (7773&Aring;), all of which show evidence of P Cygni profiles. The FWHM of the emission portion of the H&alpha; line is 900&plusmn;200 km/s. The terminal velocity of the absorption portion of the H&alpha; line may be as high as 2000 km/s. The spectrum of AT 2018fsy is consistent with the early, post-fireball, stage of a classical nova eruption within M31. Given the line widths and the possible presence of Fe II lines, this is more likely an Fe II nova. LT follow-up photometry of AT 2018fsy will commence. We will also attempt to obtain a later time spectrum."
317,ATEL #12013,"The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) collaboration reports the discovery of a new TeV gamma-ray source HAWC J0635+070. It was discovered in a search for extended sources covering 1128 days of HAWC observations with a test statistic value of 27 (>5&sigma; pre-trials), following the method presented in [Abeysekara et al. 2017, ApJ, 843, 40]. Its significance in the 2HWC data set excluded it from being included in the catalog (~3.5&sigma; pre-trials), but with the addition of ~600 more days of data it now satisfies that criterion. The best-fit J2000.0 equatorial position is RA=98.71&plusmn;0.20&deg;, Dec=7.00&plusmn;0.22&deg;, with a Gaussian 1-sigma extent of 0.65&deg;&plusmn;0.18&deg;. The spectral energy distribution is well-fit by a power law with spectral index -2.15&plusmn;0.17. The differential flux at 10 TeV is (8.6 &plusmn; 3.2) &times; 10^-15 TeV-1 cm-2 s-1. All errors are statistical only; further morphological and spectral analysis as well as studies of the systematic uncertainty are ongoing. Given its spectrum and morphology, we believe HAWC J0635+070 may be the TeV halo of the pulsar PSR J0633+0632 (Edot = 1.2e+35 erg s-1, dist = 1.35 kpc, age = 59 kyr, unknown proper motion [Manchester et al., 2005, AJ, 129]).

318,ATEL #12014,"SN 2018anu was discovered by CRTS on 2018-03-29 (TNS Astronomical Transient Report No.17554) at V=18.8. ATLAS detected the source on 2018-04-05 at o=18.5, and it faded to ~19 mag before rising again over the past 80 days to 18.2 mag (o-band). The transient was observed with SPRAT (Piascik et al. 2014) on the Liverpool Telescope (Steele et al, 2004) on 2018-September 05.86 (UT). The spectrum is similar to SNe II, showing a strong H alpha P-Cygni line with an expansion velocity of -6500 km/s. SNID gives a best match to Type IIP SN 2005cs, 15 d past explosion at a z=0.039. The SN is offset from the galaxy, GALEXASC J173615.16+185850.6. A nearby galaxy (CGCG 112-011 NED02) has a NED spectroscopic redshift of z=0.039120, consistent with that from the SN spectral fit and an offset of ~30 kpc from the SN position, suggestive of a galaxy group environment. Assuming this redshift gives a current absolute magnitude of -18. The potential multiple peaks and normal Type II SN spectrum are similar to the behaviour of the unusual long-lived Type II SN, iPTF14hls (Arcavi et al. 2017, Nature, 551, 210)."

320,ATEL #12016,"We report an X-ray flare from the dMe star FT Psc on 2018 September 1 detected with the MAXI/GSC. The flare event was detected during a scan transit at 14:31 UT on 2018 September 1. Assuming the source flux was constant over the transit, we obtained the source position of (R.A., Dec) = (12.409 deg, 24.843 deg) = (00 49 38, +24 50 34) (J2000) with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short radii of 0.31 deg and 0.26 deg, respectively. The roll angle of long axis from the north direction was 43.0 deg counterclockwise. There was an additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment radius). The X-ray flux averaged over the scan was 162 +/- 35 mCrab (4.0-10.0 keV, 1 sigma error). There was no significant excess flux in the previous transit at 12:58 UT and in the next transit at 16:04 UT with an upper limit of 20 mCrab for each. We conclude that this is the X-ray flare from the dMe star FT Psc, since no other source in the ROSAT Bright Source Catalog is located in the elliptical error region. FT Psc is a single dMe star with a spectral type of M4 V (Gaidos et al. 2014). The rotation period and the distance are derived as 1.6968 day and 11.845 pc by Newton et al. (2017) and McDonald et al. (2017), respectively. If we assume the distance of 11.845 pc, the above flux is corresponding to 5e+31 erg/s in luminosity. We should note that the flare from FT Psc was also detected with the MAXI/GSC during a scan transit at 23:44 UT on 2017 May 3, with no significant detection in the previous and the next transit. With the same procedure and assumption, we obtained the source position of (R.A., Dec) = (12.714 deg, 24.742 deg) = (00 50 51, +24 44 31) (J2000) with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short radii of 0.41 deg and 0.34 deg, respectively. The roll angle of long axis from the north direction was 14.0 deg counterclockwise. There was also an additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment radius). With no other source in the ROSAT Bright Source Catalog in this error region, we conclude that this flare was also from the dMe star FT Psc. The X-ray flux averaged over the scan was 160 +/- 35 mCrab (4.0-10.0 keV, 1 sigma error), which is comparable to the newly detected flare on 2018 September 1."
321,ATEL #12009,"The MAXI/GSC nova alert system triggered on the flare-like event from the position consistent with the RS CVn binary CF Tuc during a scan transit at 07:24 UT on Sept 3 2018. Without assumptions on the source constancy, we obtain a rectangular error box for the transient source with the following corners: (R.A., Dec) = (12.498, -75.690) deg = (00 49 59, -75 41 23) (J2000) (R.A., Dec) = (15.398, -75.527) deg = (01 01 35, -75 31 37) (J2000) (R.A., Dec) = (13.924, -74.117) deg = (00 55 41, -74 07 01) (J2000) (R.A., Dec) = (11.278, -74.281) deg = (00 45 06, -74 16 51) (J2000). Since CF Tuc is the only known X-ray source in this error region, we concluded that this is an X-ray flare from CF Tuc. The observed peak X-ray flux is 147+/-29 mCrab (1 sigma error) in the 2 - 20 keV band. The peak flux is about 2 times higher than the previous flare detected by the MAXI/GSC at Jan 30 2012 (ATel #3897). Assuming a distance of 89 pc and Crab-like spectrum, the peak luminosity is 4.6 +/- 0.3 x 10<sup>32</sup> erg/s. The e-folding decay time of this flare is about 9000 sec."

The spectrum is consistent with a type IIb supernova at a few days before the maximum light. Cross-correlation with a library of supernova spectra using the ""Supernova Identification"" code (SNID; Blondin and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows that it matches with SN 1993J at t = -5 days from the maximum light. We noted that the redshift inferred from the narrow H alpha emission presented in the SN spectrum is about 0.0166, which is slightly larger than the estimation of the host galaxy KUG 2357+340 reported in NED (i.e., 0.0148).

324,ATEL #12012,"The PMS object V1647 Ori is located in the dark cloud Lynds 1630 - a region of active star formation in the Orion B complex. The first outburst of V1647 Ori was registered on 2004 by McNeil (McNeil, J. W., 2004, IAU Circ., 8284) and it continues until the end of 2006. From the spring of 2006 to the autumn of 2008, the star is at a very low level of brightness, with no photometric data about it. A second outburst of V1647 Ori was registered in 2008, when its brightness increased again to the level of the first eruption (Kun 2008, IBVS, 5850). Our photometric data obtained during the second outburst show that the star's brightness drops gradually by about 1 mad. (I-band) in the period from the end of 2008 to the beginning of 2018. Our observations were made with the telescopes of the National Astronomical Observatory Rozhen (Bulgaria). We observed the position of V1647 Ori during the night of September 3, 2018 with the 50/70 cm Schmidt telescope, and during the night of September 4, 2018, with the 2-m RCC telescope at the Rozhen Observatory. Our photometric data indicates that the star is below the registration limit in I and R bands. Therefore, the star's brightness is less than 19.5 mag. in I-band and less than 20 mag. in R-band respectively. This means that we record a second dramatic drop in brightness, similar to that observed in 2006-2008. Classification of V1647 Ori variability remains questionable. Whether it is a FUor or an EXor or maybe an intermediate object between the two classes."

We estimated the mean flux from the source during these observations to be 42.3 +/- 1.4 mCrab and 52.6 +/- 3.6 mCrab in the 20-60 keV and 60-150 keV bands respectively comparing it with that from the Crab Nebula (observed in revolution 1987).

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion, ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients), and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin of the transient. We would like to thank Las Cumbres Observatory and its staff for their continued support of ASAS-SN.

328,ATEL #12004,"We report on coordinated target-of-opportunity observations of AMXP IGR J17591-2342 during its July/August/Sept 2018 outburst (see ATEL #11941, #11954, #11957, #11970, #11981, #11988, #12000) by INTEGRAL and NuSTAR at hard X-rays/soft gamma-rays, accompanied by monitoring observations at soft X-rays by the XRT aboard The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The dedicated INTEGRAL ToO (PI. S. Tsygankov) observations have been performed during Aug. 17 14:03:53 to Aug. 19 14:08:39, 2018 for an exposure time of 163.1 ks (INT. ToO-I, INTEGRAL Revolution-1989) and Aug. 25 17:30:47 to Aug. 27 17:34:10 (INT. ToO-II, 163.1 ks, Rev-1992). The first INTEGRAL observation was coordinated with a 29.2 ks NuSTAR ToO observation (NU-ToO-II; Observation id. 80301311002) taken about 4 days later than a public NuSTAR ToO (exposure 27.1 ks; NU-ToO-I; Obs. id. 90401331002). Swift monitored IGR J17591-2342 for 0.47 ks (Obs. id. 00010804004) and 3.94 ks (Obs. ids. 00010804006/7) during INT. ToO-I and INT. ToO-II, respectively. Spectral analysis of the ISGRI 20-300 keV near-real time data of INT. ToO-I adopting a power-law model yielded a 20-60 keV flux of 9.1 +/- 0.7 mCrab and a photon index of 2.02 +/- 0.10. The second NuSTAR ToO overlapping with INT. ToO-I showed a photon-index of 1.87 +/- 0.01 and a 20-60 keV flux of 6.81 +/- 0.08 mCrab (combined Swift XRT / NuSTAR fit), slightly lower, but consistent with the ISGRI flux, because we observed an increasing count-rate trend during this second NuSTAR ToO, contrary to the first NuSTAR observation which showed a decaying count rate trend (20-60 keV flux: 15.7 +/- 0.08 mCrab; photon-index 1.84 +/- 0.01). Spectral analysis of INT. ToO-II 20-300 keV data yielded a 20-60 keV flux of 18.2 +/- 0.7 mCrab, twice the flux as observed during the INT. ToO-I, and a photon-index of 1.92 +/- 0.05. Moreover, the source is now significantly detected up to ~150 keV in line with the assumed power-law model. Apparently, a re-brightening already set in during the beginning of the first INTEGRAL ToO on Aug. 18, 2018 (MJD 58348). Analysis of ISGRI data taken during (public) Galactic Bulge observations (PI E. Kuulkers) of Rev-1994 and 1995 (end Sept. 2, 2018; 16:42:46) showed that the source is still bright with 20-60 keV fluxes in the range 25 - 38 mCrab (see   for the preliminary outburst profile for the 20-60 keV band; NuSTAR data points are indicated by filled squares). We also performed a timing analysis of the 20-300 keV ISGRI data of INTEGRAL Revolutions 1989, 1992, 1994 (Gal. Bulge) and 1995 (Gal. Bulge) adopting the NICER timing model given in Table 1 of Sanna et al. (2018) (arXiv:1808.10195). We clearly detected the 1.9 ms pulsed signal in the 20-150 keV band at 5.2 sigma confidence level with a profile shape similar to that observed by NuSTAR during NU-TOO-I. Finally, we also searched the NuSTAR, INTEGRAL JEM-X (3-20 keV) and XRT data streams for X-ray bursts from IGR J17591-2342, and found none. Because of the peculiar outburst behaviour of the source with a re-brightening onset at Aug. 18, 2018 we decided to apply for an XMM-Newton ToO, which has been granted. Further low/high-energy observations of this enigmatic source are strongly encouraged. We thank the INTEGRAL, NuSTAR and Swift teams for scheduling our ToO observations."

The outburst had actually started on July 22, 2018 (ATel #11981) and reached its peak on July 25, with a flux of ~50mCrab in the Swift/BAT energy range (15-150 keV). Since then, the outburst smoothly decayed to lower flux values, being detected at a flux of 3 mCrab by NICER (2-10 keV) on August 15th (ATel #11957). During observations of the Galactic Bulge region between August 30, 21:10 and August 31, 00:52 (UT), a significant rebrightening of the source has been detected by IBIS/ISGRI. The flux estimated from the mosaic image is ~33 mCrab in the 20-40 keV energy range. The source is barely at the edge of the JEMX field of view. We derive 3-sigma upper limits of ~20 mCrab (3-10 keV) and ~40 mCrab (10-25 keV) in the JEM-X mosaics. The IBIS/ISGRI spectrum can be fit with a powerlaw model with spectral index 2, showing no significant spectral variations when compared to the IBIS/ISGRI spectrum of the system measured on August 11. INTEGRAL will be observing the region around this source until September 4th. We encourage observations at other wavelengths."

Our observations were carried out ~19 days (on 28 Aug 2018) after the reported start of the outburst. The AAVSO ( ) and ASASSN ( ) light curves of this source suggest that it has maintained a similar optical brightness as reported during ATel #11937.

The source was detected at 13.27&plusmn;0.05 mag in the um2 band and at 13.20&plusmn;0.05 mag in the uw2 band. We also obtained a UV spectrum (1650-5000 &#8491;) using the UVOT grism. Our spectrum shows lines similar to those reported by Munari et al. (ATel #11937) in the overlapping wavelength range. A full analysis of the spectrum is in progress. The UV spectrum resembles that of the symbiotic binary CI Cyg (e.g., Mikolajewska et al. 2003, Stencel et al. 1983). The source was also detected by the X-ray Telescope (XRT) at ~0.01 c/s (0.5-10 keV). Unfortunately, the X-ray spectral shape of the source could not be constrained as not enough photons were collected during the observation. Assuming a power low model with an index of 2 and a column density of 2E21 cm<sup>-2</sup>, we obtained (using WebPIMMS) an unabsorbed flux of Fx~5E-13 erg/cm<sup>2</sup>/s (0.5-10 keV). Assuming that the source is at ~3.6 kpc (ATel #11937), the corresponding 0.5-10 keV luminosity is ~8E32 erg/s. We thank the Swift team for scheduling our observations."

339,ATEL #11995,"GK Per is currently undergoing a dwarf nova outburst (AAVSO <a href="" "">Alert Notice 649</a>). GK Per underwent a classical nova eruption in 1901 (<a href="" "">Pickering 1901</a>, <a href="" "">Hale 1901</a>). We obtained a spectrum of the current outburst with the FRODOSpec spectrograph (<a href="" "">Barnsley et al. 2012</a>) on the 2-m Liverpool Telescope (<a href="" "">Steele et al. 2004</a>), with a wavelength coverage of 3900 to 5100 &Aring; and 5900 to 8000 &Aring; and resolution of R ~ 5400, on 2018 Aug 29.17 UT. The spectrum shows strong Balmer emission lines (H&alpha;, H&beta;, H&gamma;, H&delta;, H&epsilon;). We measure the FWHM to be 540+/-30 km/s for H&alpha;, 540+/-30 km/s for H&beta; and 500+/-30 km/s for H&gamma;. The spectrum also shows strong emission from He II 4686 &Aring;, which may be slightly broader at FWHM = 610+/-30 km/s. These velocities are similar to those seen during the 2015 outburst (ATel #7217). We see several He I lines, including 4388, 4471, 4922, 5016, 6678, 7065 &Aring;. The highest S/N He I lines (6678 and 7065) clearly show a double-peaked structure (evidence for this can also be seen in the other He I lines), unlike the He II line, which is relatively well described by a Gaussian profile. The Balmer lines do not show a clear double peak, but they are somewhat asymmetric. We also identify weaker features of OI (7773 &Aring;) and N III (4638 &Aring;)."

A 600s exposure spectrum, covering 3400 - 9000 Angstroms at a resolution of ~18 Angstroms with a 1.5 arcsec slit, was obtained in clear conditions. The spectrum shows a very blue continuum with H I Balmer absorption lines, with H-alpha filled in but not obvious emission reversal. H-beta has an EW of 6.6 Angstrom and FWHM of 41.3 Angstrom.

341,ATEL #11992,"We explored the archival images of the near-infrared (NIR) VVV survey (vvvsurvey.org; Minniti et al. 2010, New Astron., 15, 433) of the Galactic Bulge and inner disk, obtained with the 4.1m VISTA telescope at Cerro Paranal (Chile), containing the soft X-ray error box the transient IGR J17503-2636 (ATel #11952) that was recently detected with INTEGRAL. JHKs images were acquired on 2010 April 9 between 06:53 and 07:04 UT under an average seeing of 0.9 arcsec. Further ZY photometry was collected on 2011 August 31 between 03:14 and 03:19 UT with a seeing of 1.0 arcsec. Exposure times were 24 s in the J band, 8 s in both H and Ks, and 20 s in both Z and Y bands; the image scale is 0.34 arcsec/pixel for all frames. A single NIR object is present inside the 2.2 arcsec-radius Swift/XRT error circle (ATel #11952) at the following coordinates (J2000): RA = 17:50:18.06 Dec = -26:36:16.7 (coordinate errors are +-0.1 arcsec at 1-sigma confidence level). This position is 0.9 arcsecs from, thus formally outside, the corrected 0.7 arcsec-radius Chandra localization uncertainty of IGR J17503-2636 (ATels #11990, #11991); however, the two positions are mutually consistent within the respective uncertainties at a confidence level better than 1.5 sigma. This NIR source has magnitudes Z > 19.9 Y = 17.90+-0.06 J = 14.23+-0.01 H = 11.79+-0.01 Ks= 10.65+-0.01 (confidence levels are 1-sigma for magnitude uncertainties and 3-sigma for the upper limit). We point out that the shape information flag associated with this object is ""-1"" (indicating a stellar source) in all the four bands (YJHKs) in which it was detected. The source shows variability of ~1.2 mag across the 49 Ks frames available for its field in the VVV survey over a time baseline of ~3.5 years, from April 2010 to November 2013. It should be stressed that the object is close to the saturation limit in the Ks-band and therefore the variability may partly be due to spurious effects due to different saturation levels depending on the sky conditions during each pointing; however, this issue alone cannot account for the whole observed variation, which should thus mostly be intrinsic. We moreover note that, according to Nishiyama (2009, ApJ, 696, 1407), the Galactic Ks-band absorption along the line of sight of this source is ~2 mag, which implies an optical reddening A_V ~ 20 mag and explains why this object is not detected at wavelengths shorter than the Y-band (indeed, optical surveys such as the <a href= >USNO-A2.0</a> catalogue do not contain sources at the NIR position). All the above information is consistent with the NIR object being an heavily reddened OB (super)giant star located beyond the Galactic Center, at ~10 kpc from Earth; this distance implies a peak X-ray luminosity of ~2e36 erg/s according to the data reported in ATel #11952. We thus suggest that this source is the NIR counterpart of IGR J17503-2636 and that this object is a high-mass X-ray binary, possibly of the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient subclass given its X-ray luminosity at maximum brightness and the rapid decay of its X-ray emission as reported from the Chandra observations (ATel #11990)."
342,ATEL #11991,"In ATEL #11990, the uncertainty radius for the source position is quoted incorrectly as 1.1 arcsec. The correct uncertainty radius is 0.7 arcsec, from a statistical uncertainty of 0.3 arcsec and a systematic uncertainty of 0.6 arcsec."
343,ATEL #11988,"Starting on 2018 Aug 23 at 17:53 UTC, Chandra performed a 20 ksec follow up observation of IGR J15791-2342 (see ATELs 11941, 11942, 11946 11954, 11957, 11970, 11981, and 11985) using the High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS). The Chandra position, determined from intersecting the dispersed spectra of the High Energy Gratings (HEG) and Medium Energy Gratings (MEG) is (J2000) RA = 17:59:02.83, Dec = -23:43:0.8.0. This position is within 0.6 arcsec of that reported from VLT observations of an IR counterpart (ATel 11970) and within 0.5 arcsec of that reported from ATCA observations of a radio counterpart (ATel 11954). Without any other sources within the Chandra field of view to further refine the astrometry, these small differences are consistent with typical Chandra astrometric uncertainties. The source remains bright with a 1-9 keV flux of (1.56+/-0.03) x 10^-10 erg/cm^2/s (90% confidence level, not corrected for absorption), with minimal long time scale variability over the course of this observation. Preliminary fits indicate that the X-ray spectra of IGR J15791-2342 are well-described by an absorbed power law with photon index of 1.80+/-0.06 (90% confidence level) and NH column of (4.9 +/-0.2) x 10^22 cm^-2, where we have modeled the absorption with the prescription (including abundances) of Wilms, Allen, & McCray (2000, ApJ, 542, 914). The measurement of the absorption column density is partly driven by detection of a Si edge; however, further work is required to assess what fraction of the absorption is local to the system and what fraction is attributable to the interstellar medium. There is some evidence for further high resolution structure within the HETGS spectra. As the source remains bright, additional multi-wavelength observations are encouraged."
344,ATEL #11989,"In long-term monitoring program of microquasars with the RATAN-600 radio telescope we have detected the bright flare from the well known X-ray binary SS433. On 25 August (MJD 58355.76) the flux at 2.3 GHz reached a level of 3.2 Jy and the total spectrum is well fitted by the power law: S_nu[Jy]=6.4nu^(-0.81)[GHz] at frequencies higher 2.3 GHz, almost the same spectrum as we have detected in October 2012 (ATel #4484). In the light curves of <A HREF="" ""> Swift/BAT </A> and <a HREF ="" ""> MAXI </a> we can see the obvious signs of activity. It is interesting that during last 70 days there were three powerful flaring events in SS433 (the link on the RATAN light curves are given in ATel #11870). Second one consisted of two radio peaks, first one was associated with the bright optical outburst by Goranskij et al.

345,ATEL #11990,"As part of an ongoing Chandra X-ray Observatory program for the precise localization of X-ray transients in low-mass X-ray binaries, we obtained a short Chandra/HRC-S observation of IGR J17503-2636, following reports of its 2018 August outburst (ATEL #11952). Our observation was made in TIMING mode on 2018 August 23, 23:31 TT (MJD 58353.98), which was 12 days after the outburst was first detected by INTEGRAL. The exposure livetime was 1016.6 s. The X-ray source had faded considerably by the time of our observation, yielding only a weak detection. We observed 11 counts within the 2.2 arcsec Swift error circle (ATEL #11952), compared to an expected background of 1 count. All 11 counts fell within a 1.8 arcsec radius of their mean position, and 6 counts fell within 0.5 arcsec radius of this position. Given the background count rate of 0.068 count/arcsec^2, the chance probability of detecting at least 11 counts within a 2.2 arcsec radius is 1.2e-8, corresponding to an equivalent Gaussian significance of 5.7 sigma. The chance probability of detecting at least 6 counts within a 0.5 arcsec radius is 3.0e-11, corresponding to an equivalent Gaussian significance of 6.6 sigma. We associate the 6 closely clustered counts with the core of the Chandra point-spread function (PSF). The mean sky position for these 6 counts is RA(J2000) = 17h 50m 17.99s Dec(J2000) = -26d 36' 16.7"" with an uncertainty radius of 1.1 arcsec (from a statistical uncertainty of 0.9 arcsec and a systematic uncertainty of 0.6 arcsec). This is consistent with the Swift X-ray error circle (ATEL #11952, 2.2 arcsec radius), lying 1.0 arcsec from its center. The arrival times of the 11 events showed evidence for variability or flaring. In particular, we observed 2 events in the PSF core within a 3-second interval with a spatial separation of 0.16 arcsec, part of a cluster of 5 events (from the entire sample) observed within a 1-minute interval. Associating all 11 counts with the source region, the background-subtracted mean count rate was 0.010(3) count/s. The spectral shape in the HRC-S band is not well determined but is highly absorbed (ATEL #11952). Assuming an absorbed power-law X-ray spectrum with photon index gamma=2.0 and absorption column N_H = 1e23 cm^(-2), our count rate corresponds to an absorbed X-ray flux of 2.9e-12 erg/cm^2/s in the 0.2-10 keV band."

353,ATEL #11980,"We obtained SALT (+RSS) spectroscopy of ASASSN-18tb (= SN 2018fhw; ATel #11976) on 2018 August 23.3 UT, covering the wavelength range 350-940 nm. Cross-correlation of the supernova spectrum with a template library using SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows a good match to the type-Ia SN 2003iv at +1 day after maximum light. We also placed the longslit through the nucleus of the host galaxy 2MASX J04180598-6336523 and derive a heliocentric redshift of 5090 +/- 30 km/s using cross-correlation with galaxy templates. The expansion velocity of the supernova (measured to the trough of the Si II rest 635.5 nm line) is approximately 9,980 km/s. Given the location of ASASSN-18tb in the TESS Sector 1 field, continued follow-up observations of this supernova are encouraged.

357,ATEL #11975,"We present results of the Swift observation of SS 433 performed in follow-up of a bright optical outburst reported in ATel#11870. The observation started at 2018-07-25 07:19:01T (MJD=58324.30567, ObsID 00035190036), i.e. 7.534d after the outburst. The observation consisted of two segments separated by 0.397d (34.3ks). Total exposure time with the Swift/XRT for two segments equals 1030.5s collected in Photon Counting mode, 353.5s for the first segment and 677s for the second one. The UVOT accumulated image in U-filter during the single exposure with 350s duration started 87s after the beginning of the first XRT segment. The light curve and spectra were extracted from the 50'' circular aperture, the background was extracted from the annulus surrounding the source with 96'' inner radius and 480'' outer radius. Data reduction and processing have been performed using the standard Swift routines (XRTDAS) and XSELECT tool of the heasoft package (v6.24) and most recent calibration data. The source has been detected in 0.3-10 keV band by XRT and in U band by UVOT with the mean background-corrected count rates 0.48&plusmn;0.02 cts/s and 3.01&plusmn;0.16 cts/s, respectively. The latter corresponds to the flux density F<sub>&lambda;</sub>=4.8&plusmn;0.24 erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup> /&#8491;=180&plusmn;1 &micro;Jy (17.51 Vega magnitude) in the U band, consistent with previous Swift observations of Dolan et al. 2007 and ATel#6364. The 0.5-10 keV light curve shows significant variation between the two segments, with the first one being on average a factor of 1.5 brighter then the second one. There is no significant variation in relative contributions of narrower bands, which indicates absence of strong variation in the absorbing column density or relative contribution of the jets and the hard (cold reflection) component (see Khabibullin et al. 2016). The only exception might be a significant increase in [6-10] keV count rate during the second segment of the observation. This conclusion is confirmed by analysis of the spectra extracted from the full observation and individual segments. We fit the spectra with with a model consisting of bremsstrahlung continuum and line emission from the pair of baryonic relativistic jets (as described in Medvedev et al. 2018). The spectral shape of all three datasets appeared to be consistent with the latest XMM-Newton observation, but with the overall normalization 0.23&plusmn;0.03, N<sub>H</sub>=1.25&plusmn;0.15&times;10<sup>22</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>, and redshift of the blue jet z<sub>b</sub>=-0.034&plusmn;0.026 (redshift of the other jet is not constrained). This is consistent with the expectation for the SS 433's precession phase at the moment of the observation (0.22). Importantly, fitting of the spectrum with simpler models (e.g. absorbed powerlaw or bremsstrahlung) results in significantly lower values of N<sub>H</sub> because of the dominant contribution of jets spectral line emission below 2 keV. The bremsstrahlung continuum has temperature 30 keV and unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV flux 4.0&times;10<sup>-11</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>-2</sup>. The jets line emission gives unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV flux at level 2.6&times;10<sup>-11</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>-2</sup> (1.8&times;10<sup>-11</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>-2</sup> below 2 keV). The detected X-ray emission corresponds to the class of SS 433's low X-ray states, which are 3-5 times dimmer then the more common normal out-of-eclipse states (Marshall et al. 2013). This is illustrated by comparison of the current observation with Chandra/HETGS data of another low-state spectrum (ObsID 1020). The latter indeed has similar overall intensity, however, with a slight excess at low energies. Noteworthy, according to the RATAN-600 radio light curve, SS 433 experienced another bright radio outburst at the moment of the X-ray observation reported here. We are grateful for Swift team for rapid scheduling of our observations. Data products and supplementary materials:  "

The object is almost coincident (1.5 arcsec) with the position of an object listed in Gaia Data Release 2 (GDR2; Gaia Collaboration 2018 A+A in press, arXiv:1804.09365) as source 6185371175372936064, with magnitude G=17.90. The source has a relatively large parallax of 5.52 +/- 0.15 mas (181 +/- 5 pc without systematic correction), and large proper motion. SkyMapper DR1 images (Wolf et al. 2018, PASA, 2018, 35, 10) available through Aladin Sky Atlas (Bonnarel et al. 2000, A+AS, 143, 33) shows a very faint object with interesting features: the R-band image is elongated, while the I-band image is also elongated but perpendicular to and centered in the R-band elongation. This structure could be indication of a bipolar nebula or outflow, due to a probable H-alpha emission contribution to the R-band. Furthermore, the source is detected particularly bright in GALEX, faint in WISE/W1/W2, and detectable in 2MASS (but shifted due to proper motion). Gaia DR2, GALEX and other survey images support that ASASSN-18su is a CV as reported in Atel #11969, but also this is a nearby CV with probable ejected material (as suggested by SkyMapper images).

364,ATEL #11970,"We report on near-infrared (NIR) follow-up of the new accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J17591-2342, discovered by INTEGRAL and localized by Swift and ATCA (ATel #11941, #11942, #11954). We obtained imaging in the Ks and H bands, using the High Acuity Wide-field K-Band Imager (HAWK-I) mounted on UT4 of the Very Large Telescope on Cerro Paranal, Chile. Conditions were excellent, with seeing <1"". We obtained 7 exposures of 195s in Ks, with each co-added exposure consisting of 13 dithered 15s exposures. In H we obtained 7 exposures of 65s, with each co-add consisting of 13 dithered 5s exposures. Data were reduced with ESO's reflex pipeline and we extract photometry from the pipeline products. We detect a source at RA (J2000) =17:59:02.87, Dec (J2000) = -23:43:08.2, with magnitudes of H=19.56 +/- 0.07 and Ks=18.37 +/- 0.07. The source position is completely consistent with the ATCA position reported by Russell et. al. (ATel #11954) and the typical astrometric uncertainty in the HAWK-I images is ~0.03"". We therefore propose that this is the NIR counterpart of the pulsar. Though the counterpart is faint, follow-up observations are encouraged, particularly NIR spectroscopy."

Since Jun. 2018 the star has been under scrutiny in an attempt to detect the initiation of an outburst. This Be star has undergone several spectroscopically active intervals in the past few years. Equipment used is a T0.28m telescope with R=10000 echelle spectrograph, Atik 460ex CCD camera, PRISM v10 software for acquisition and ISIS v5.8.0 for spectra reduction. No substantial spectral changes were detected between Jun 27.089 and Aug 11.009 (33 spectra). However, the Halpha line showed a very significant increase in emission on Aug 14.997 (exposure time of 4800 sec, S/N > 50). Halpha line has shown drastic V/R changes every night since then. Emission was not visible on Hbeta line on Aug 14.997 spectrum but was detected in emission with a 6000 sec spectrum taken on Aug t 15.966 as a single emission on the blueward of the absorption line. The Aug 15.966 spectrum is also showing a broad, weak blueshifted emission on Hgamma. Further spectroscopic observations are strongly encouraged, especially across a broad wavelength range and at high resolution.

In ATel #11965 the wavelengths of the weak emission features seen in the Aug 16 spectrum were incorrectly reported. The first weak feature is actually at ~4945 Ang, possibly on top of a broader (~100 Ang) bump. A second weak feature is at ~4390 Ang. The first weak feature may be associated with a blend of He and high-ionization C/N lines often seen in very young SNe, implying a redshift of z=0.05.

A second narrow, weak feature also appears to be present at 4155 Ang. We note that the ~4690 Ang feature is close to the rest wavelength of HeII, raising the possibility that this is a foreground Galactic transient."
374,ATEL #11957,"Following the INTEGRAL discovery of the new transient IGR J17591-2342 and its precise localization by the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory (ATel #11941, #11942), we asked for target-of-opportunity observations with NuSTAR and NICER. NuSTAR observed the source from 2018-08-13 at 22:36 to 08-14 at 14:26 for an exposure of 27 ks. NICER observed from 2018-08-15 at 00:01 to 08-15 at 14:08:00 for a total exposure of 7.2 ks. Timing analysis of both data sets revealed that the new transient is an accreting millisecond pulsar (AMSP) in outburst with a spin frequency of ~527 Hz, an orbital period of 0.37 days, projected semi-major axis of ~1.23 lt-s, and ascending node epoch MJD 58343.7. The 3-30 keV flux as measured by NuSTAR was 4.2 &times;10<sup>-10</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>-2</sup>, corresponding to a luminosity of 3&times;10<sup>36</sup>erg/s at 8 kpc distance. The 0.1-10 keV flux measured by NICER was 1.3&times;10<sup>-10</sup> ergs/cm<sup>2</sup>/s. The spectrum could be described with absorbed thermal Comptonization plus a soft black-body, as usually observed for this class of sources. The significance of the periodicity detection is more than five sigmas in <~ 1 ksec exposures in both datasets, but the spin and orbital parameter values should be considered as preliminary at the current status of analysis. We note that the ATCA radio flux reported in ATel #11954 is about three times larger than for other two AMSP (see e.g., Fig. 6 in <a href="" "", target=""_blank"">Tudor at al., 2017</a>). Multi-wavelength observations are encouraged to follow up the source outburst evolution together with the approved Swift monitoring. We thank the Swift, NuSTAR and NICER teams for scheduling and performing these observations on a short notice. NICER is a 0.2-12 keV X-ray telescope operating on the International Space Station; the NICER mission and portions of the NICER science team activities are funded by NASA."
375,ATEL #11958,"On behalf of a Danish Summer School in Observational Astrophysics currently being held at the Nordic Optical Telescope, we report the spectroscopic classification of ASASSN-18rt (IAU name SN 2018fav). The candidate was discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN: Shappee et al. 2014) on 2018-08-12.9 with an apparent g-band magnitude of 18. The host galaxy is 2MASX J00455851-2156353 and has a redshift of z=0.037923 (Jones et al. 2009). Observations were performed with the 2.56 m Nordic Optical Telescope equipped with ALFOSC (range 350-950 nm; resolution 1.6 nm FWHM) on 2018-08-16.2. Close inspection of the spectrum reveals it to most likely be a Type-Ic around maximum light. Comparison of the spectrum with a library of template spectra using SNID (Blondin and Tonry 2007) reveals decent matches with SN 2004aw around maximum light."
376,ATEL #11959,"We report on spectroscopic confirmation of ASASSN-18pf as a classical nova. The optical transient was reported by Stanek et al. (2018, ATel #11857) as a possible LMC nova on on 2018 Jul. 13.4. The discovery magnitude (V ~ 13) is consistent with that of a nova in the LMC during the decline from maximum light. We obtained two (low and medium resolution) spectra of the source with the Goodman spectrograph on the SOAR telescope on 2018 Aug 15.4 and 16.4 (R ~ 1000 and R ~ 5000, respectively). The spectra are dominated by emission lines of H I, He I, N, Fe II, C, and O (see below a full list of the line identification). We measure a FWHM of ~1300 &plusmn; 50 km/s (for H&#945; and H&#946;). The spectra is that of a classical nova in the transition phase. The central wavelength of the Balmer emission lines, as measured by Gaussian fitting, is red-shifted by ~ 290 km/s consistent with LMC radial velocities.

377,ATEL #11954,"Following the recent report of the new X-ray transient IGR J17591-2342 (Atels #11941, #11942, #11946), we conducted DDT radio observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). We observed IGR J17591-2342 on 2018 August 14 between 10:38 UT and 16:23 UT (MJD 58344.56 +/- 0.12). The radio observations were taken simultaneously at central frequencies of 5.5 and 9.0 GHz, with 2 GHz of bandwidth at each frequency. PKS 1934-638 and 1817-254 were used for flux and phase calibration, respectively. The data were reduced and imaged following standard procedures in CASA (v4.7; McMullin et al. 2007). Imaging was carried out with a Briggs robust parameter of 0 to both balance sensitivity with resolution, as well as minimise the effects from diffuse emission and other bright sources in the field. With the telescope in a hybrid 1.5D configuration due to a current reconfiguration, these choices provided angular resolutions of 6.8""x1.4"" at 5.5 GHz and 3.9""x0.9"" at 9 GHz (with a position angle 15 degrees North of East). We significantly detected the radio counterpart to IGR J17591-2342 at a position coincident with the reported X-ray position (ATel #11942). We measure a 9.0 GHz radio position of: RA (J2000) =17:59:02.86 +/- 0.04, Dec (J2000) = -23:43:08.3 +/- 0.1, where the errors are the uncertainties on the fitted position, which are larger than the theoretical statistical error of centroiding (Beam/2*SNR). Fitting for a point source in the image plane, we measure a flux density of 1.09 +/- 0.02 mJy at 5.5 GHz and 1.14 +/- 0.02 mJy at 9.0 GHz. The results give a radio spectral index, &alpha;, of 0.1 +/- 0.3, where S<sub>&nu;</sub> &prop; &nu;<sup>&alpha;</sup>, suggesting a flat spectrum from a compact radio jet. This spectral index implies a 5-GHz radio luminosity of (4.7 +/- 0.2)E29*(d/8kpc)<sup>2</sup> erg/s. Swift/XRT observed IGR J17591-2342 on the same day as our radio observation (snapshots were taken either side of the radio observation on 2018 August 14 between 00:37:01-00:43:57 UT and 16:27:02-16:33:58 UT; obs ID: 0001084002). We extracted the data using the online XRT pipeline (Evans et al. 2009) and fitted it with an absorbed power-law model. We find a best fit with n<sub>H</sub> = (4.4 +/- 0.8)E22 cm<sup>-2</sup> and a photon index, Gamma, of 1.6 +/- 0.3, with an unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV X-ray flux of (3.4 +/- 1.5)E-10 erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup>, similar to previously reported results (ATel #11942), albeit at a marginally lower X-ray flux, indicating the source has faded slightly. This flux implies an 0.5-10 keV luminosity of (3 +/- 1)E36*(d/8kpc)<sup>2</sup> erg/s. Comparing the determined radio and X-ray luminosities to those of typical hard state X-ray binaries, our results imply that IGR J17591-2342 is consistent with a black hole low-mass X-ray binary, most likely on the radio bright track. We thank Jamie Stevens and the ATNF staff for making these ATCA observations possible."

379,ATEL #11956,"The H.E.S.S. array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes was used to carry out follow-up observations of AT2018cow (ATel #11727) between the 3rd and 5th July 2018, for a total of 2.4 hours. H.E.S.S. observed the region around the source position (RA, Dec) = (244.00, 22.27) from ATel #11727. Preliminary off-site calibration and analysis with the data taken by the CT5 telescope (CT5 mono), searching for a point-like gamma-ray source from the source target, revealed no significant detection. These observations allowed us to place preliminary upper limits on the integrated flux (assuming a spectral index value of -2) from the source target: above the energy threshold 220 GeV (with a 95% confidence limit) an upper limit of 5e-12 ph cm^-2 s^-1; above 1 TeV (with a 95% confidence limit) an upper limit of 5e-13 ph cm^-2 s^-1. H.E.S.S. is an array of five imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes for the detection of very-high-energy gamma-ray sources and is located in the Khomas Highlands in Namibia. It was constructed and is operated by researchers from Armenia, Australia, Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Japan, Poland, South Africa, Sweden, UK, and the host country, Namibia."
380,ATEL #11950,A. J. Nayana (NCRA-TIFR) and Poonam Chandra (NCRA-TIFR) report on behalf of a larger collaboration: We observed broad lined Type Ic supernova AT2018cow (Smartt et al. ATel# 11727) with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) on 2018 Aug 12.71 UT in the 1390 MHz band. We clearly detect radio emission at the supernova position. The flux density of the supernova in this band is 438+/-82 uJy. More observations are planned. We thank GMRT staff for carrying out the observations.
381,ATEL #11951,"We report the detection of a 55 Hz high-frequency QPO in the new black hole transient MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11488, #11510, #11576, #11578, #11820). We analysed the NICER observations of MAXI J1820+070 during March 12 to April 16 (ObsId 1200120101-1200120130). For the timing analysis, we produced a 16-s power density spectra (PDS) for each observation with a time resolution of 2 ms, so that the Nyquist frequency is 256 Hz. We find a clear high-frequency QPO in the PDS of ObsID 1200120107. The centroid frequency of the QPO obtained from the fit with a model of multiple Lorentzian functions is 55.12+/-0.06 Hz, the FWHM is 2.00+/-0.20 Hz, the fractional rms is about 1%. A weak second harmonic at the frequency of ~110 Hz was also present in the PDS. The high-frequency QPO was clearly detected until the observation 1200120120. During this period, the centroid frequency of the QPO was stable at ~55 Hz. The frequency of this high-frequency QPO in MAXI J1820+070 is close to the 67-Hz QPO seen in GRS 1915+105. However, the 67-Hz QPO in GRS 1915+105 normally appears in a relatively soft state, but the 55-Hz QPO we observed in MAXI J1820+070 is present in the hard state. We are making a detailed analysis on this QPO to explore its physical origin."
382,ATEL #11953,"We obtained a spectrum of the nuclear transient AT 2018dyk/ZTF18aajupnt on 2018 August 12.3 UT with the robotic FLOYDS instrument mounted on the Las Cumbres Observatory 2-meter telescope on Haleakala, Hawai'i, under the ""Transients in Galaxy Centers"" program (PI: Arcavi). Using Superfit (Howell et al. 2005, ApJ, 634, 1190), we find a reasonable fit to the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-14ae (Holoien et al. 2014, MNRAS, 445, 3263; Arcavi et al. 2014, ApJ, 793, 38) at the redshift of the host galaxy (z=0.037; SDSS). The spectrum displays possible broad H-alpha, H-beta and He II emission lines, similar to those seen in other TDEs. Unlike other TDEs, however, it displays narrow H-beta and He II emission lines not seen in the SDSS host spectrum, stronger narrow H-alpha compared to the SDSS host spectrum, and it does not display a blue continuum. The ZTF light curve retrieved from the ZTF public alert stream via MARS ( ) peaks at an apparent magnitude of about 18.6, which at the deduced redshift corresponds to an absolute magnitude of -17.4, several magnitudes fainter than most TDEs but similar to the TDE iPTF16fnl (Blagorodnova et al. 2017, ApJ, 844, 46). The SDSS spectrum of the host galaxy shows weak H-alpha emission indicative of only weak current star formation, and does not show strong Balmer absorption which would be indicative of a recent strong starburst. The recent star formation history of the host galaxy appears similar to that of TDE PTF09ge (Arcavi et al. 2014, ApJ, 793, 38), which formed less than 1% of its current stellar mass in the last Gyr (French et al. 2016, ApJL, 818, 21; French et al. 2017, ApJ, 835, 176).

The source is detected at 7 &sigma; for an effective exposure time of 17.9 ks on the combined JEM-X mosaics from which we obtain the following fluxes: 12 &plusmn;2 mCrab (&approx;2.0&times;10<sup>-10</sup> erg/cm<sup>2</sup>/s) between 3-10 keV, 17 &plusmn;3 mCrab (&approx;1.9&times;10<sup>-10</sup> erg/cm<sup>2</sup>/s) between 10-25 keV.

The source is not detected by IBIS/ISGRI above 20 keV, and we estimate a 3-&sigma; upper limit about 10 mCrab (20-40 keV). Thanks to a 1-ks exposure with Swift/XRT in PC mode between August 13<sup>th</sup> 19:41-20:13 (UTC) we can refine the source position at: RA = 267.57527&deg; = 17h 50m 18.06s Dec = -26.60458&deg; = -26d 36m 16.5s.

384,ATEL #11946,"Neutron Star, Transient On 2018 August 10 to 11, IGR J17591-2342 was discovered as a new X-ray transient by INTEGRAL, confirmed on August 12 with a refined position by Swift (ATel #11941, #11942). We report on optical observations of the field of IGR J17591-2342 taken with the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) 2-m and 1-m robotic telescopes. Images were acquired with the 2-m Faulkes Telescope South (FTS; located at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia) in SDSS g', i' and PanSTARRS y-band filters on 2018 Aug 12 at 13:41-13:57 UT (less than 4 hours after the announcement of the discovery in ATel #11941). Images in SDSS r', i' and PanSTARRS y-band filters were taken on 2018 Aug 12 at 21:05-21:23 UT using a 1-m LCO telescope at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO), Sutherland, South Africa. Finally, images in g', i' and y-band filters were taken on 2018 Aug 13 at 6:30-6:46 UT with the 2-m Faulkes Telescope North (FTN; at Haleakala Observatory, Maui, Hawaii, USA). We flux calibrate our images using several close, isolated stars listed in the PanSTARRS catalogue. We also aligned and combined the FTS and FTN images taken in g', i' and y-bands to produce deeper images in these three filters (finding charts are linked below). No stars are detected within the 3.6 arcsec radius Swift XRT error circle of the X-ray source (ATel #11942), although one star is clearly detected on the edge of the error circle in all our images (labelled '1' in the i'-band finding chart below), which is also listed in the PanSTARRS and 2MASS catalogues. Its PanSTARRS coordinates (J2000) are RA = 17 59 02.693; Dec = -23 43 12.04 (3.7"" from the centre of the XRT circle) and catalogue magnitudes are g' = 25.468 +- ? (no error given); r' = 19.767 +- 0.036; i' = 17.737 +- 0.011; y = 15.505 +- 0.013. We derive magnitudes of this star from each of our images; all our r', i' and y mags agree with the catalogue values within < 0.1 +- 0.1 mag. From the combined FTS and FTN g'-band image, we measure g' = 23.0 +- 0.2 for this star - significantly brighter than the PanSTARRS value, although we suspect this apparent brightening may not be real, and could be due to the unknown error on the PanStarrs catalogue g'-band magnitude, and/or the low S/N of the star in our image. The next three closest PanSTARRS stars are located 5.5"" to 6.2"" from the centre of the XRT error circle (labelled 2 to 4 in the i'-band finding chart). Star 2 is detected in y-band only; its magnitudes agree within 0.2 +- 0.2 mags of PanSTARRS. Star 3 is not detected in any filter. Star 4 (at RA = 17 59 02.505; Dec = -23 43 07.93) has magnitudes that are brighter than the catalogue values by 0.15-0.19 mag in all i' and y images (it is not significantly detected in g' and r'). Within the 3.6"" XRT error circle, there are no additional sources detected in the combined images down to magnitude (3-sigma) limits of g' = > 22.7; i' > 21.8; y > 18.4. We will continue to image the location with the LCO telescopes while the X-ray flux increases, to see if any star brightens. The Galactic neutral hydrogen column density in the direction of IGR J17591-2342 is n_H ~ 1.4E22 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005, A&A, 440, 775; Dickey & Lockman, 1990, ARAA, 28, 215). The absorption column density from the Swift XRT spectrum was measured to be n_H = (4.2+/-0.8)x1E22 cm^-2, exceeding the Galactic value. Given these two values and adopting the relation of Guver & Ozel (2009, MNRAS, 400, 2050), the optical extinction is likely to lie in the range Av ~ 6 - 23. Infrared and longer wavelength observations (e.g. radio) are therefore strongly encouraged.

387,ATEL #11949,"Following the report of a weak X-ray outburst from the black hole transient V4641 Sgr (ATel #11931), we have performed optical follow-up observations since 2018 August 10. Observations were taken with the T17 0.43m telescope of iTelescope.Net in Siding Spring, Australia. We used a subset of comparison stars and the orbital solution in MacDonald et al. (2014) to derive the magnitude of V4641 Sgr and the corresponding orbital phase, respectively. The magnitudes of V4641 Sgr are listed below: 2018-08-10 at Phase 0.72 V=13.44 2018-08-11 at Phase 0.13 V=13.35 2018-08-12 at Phase 0.49 V=13.36 B=13.74 2018-08-13 at Phase 0.84 V=13.66 B=14.01 with a typical 1-sigma uncertainty of ~0.1 mag. By comparing the quiescent light curves in MacDonald et al. (2014), it is clear that V4641 Sgr shows increased activity in optical on 2018-08-11 and 2018-08-12 with 0.3-0.5 mag enhancement. On 2018-08-13, both the B and V magnitudes are consistent with quiescence. Our observations indicate that V4641 Sgr may be in an optical active phase. Further optical and X-ray observations are encouraged to investigate the nature of this outburst. Swift observations have been approved to follow up the source."
388,ATEL #11941,"During the observations performed in satellite revolution 1986 (spanning from 2018-08-10 15:50 to 2018-08-11 12:30 UT) toward the direction of the Galactic center, a new X-ray transient was detected by the instruments on-board INTEGRAL. The best position determined by IBIS/ISGRI is at: RA, Dec (J2000): 269.78662 -23.712973, with an associated uncertainty of 3 arcmin. According to the INTEGRAL convention, we named the new transient IGR J17591-2342. The new source is detected in the 20-40 keV (40-80 keV) mosaic realized by using all the science windows collected in the direction of the Galactic Center and Galactic Bulge at a significance of 8.7 sigma (7.7 sigma). The estimated flux of the source from the mosaic is of 13.5+/-1.5 mCrab in the 20-40 keV energy band and 21.5+/-2.7 in the 40-80 keV energy band. These values correspond to roughly 1.0E-10 erg/cm^2/s and 1.6E-10 erg/cm^2/s, respectively. The ISGRI spectrum could be preliminary described by a power-law of photon index 2.9+/-0.5. The flux measured from the spectral fit in the 20-100 keV energy band was 4.3E-10 erg/cm^2/s. The source was located at the rim of the JEM-X field of view and not detected by this instrument. Additional INTEGRAL observation of the field around the new transient are planned for 2018 August 17. A Swift/XRT ToO observation has been requested."

Swift/XRT observed the field around IGRJ17591-2342 starting from 12 August 2018 at 03:49 for about 1 ks. A single X-ray source was detected within the uncertainty circle derived from IBIS/ISGRI. The best position determined by XRT (we used the online Swift-XRT data product tool; Evans et al. 2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177): RA, Dec (J2000): 269.7622, -23.7195, with an associated uncertainty of 3.6 arcsec (at 90% c.l.).

The 0.3-10 keV flux (not corrected for absorption was (2.6+/-0.2)x1E-10 erg/cm^2/s. Additional monitoring observations with Swift/XRT have been requested.

392,ATEL #11945,"Transient We report new Chandra X-ray observations of neutron star merger GW170817 at 358.6 days post-merger, which now reveals fading at a t^-1.6 rate. Chandra obtained a 67.16 ks observation of GW170817 (obsID: 21371, PI: Troja) on 10 August 2018, at 358.6 days post-merger. GW170817 is still clearly detected, and we measure a 0.5-8 keV count rate of 4.9 (+0.9/-0.9) cts/s. We extract and fit the X-ray spectrum assuming an absorbed power-law spectral model, with fixed NH = 7.5e20 cm^-2. We measure an absorbed flux of f(0.3-8 keV) = 6.3 (+3.8/-2.1) x10^-15 erg/s/cm^2 (90% c.l.) and photon index of Gamma = 1.6 (+1.3/-0.9), which corresponds to an unabsorbed luminosity of L(0.3-10 keV) = 1.7 (+1.1/-0.5) x10^39 erg/s assuming a luminosity distance of 42.5 Mpc. The previous Chandra observation at 260.0 days showed an absorbed flux of f(0.3-8 keV) = 1.09 (+0.24/-0.20) x10^-14 erg/s/cm^2 (Nynka et al. 2018). A power-law fit of this previous 260.0 day flux to the new 358.6 day flux reveals fading at a t^-1.6 rate. This is steeper than the t^-1.3 fading observed between 159.7 and 260.0 days post-merger, and thus the X-ray afterglow light curve is now fading more rapidly."

394,ATEL #11936,"We are continuing the optical timing monitoring of the black hole transient MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11723, #11824), in parallel with dedicated photometric and spectroscopic observations (ATel #11899). Here we report further observations with our fast optical photon counters IFI+IQUEYE (mounted at the 1.2 m Galileo telescope) and AQUEYE+ (mounted at the 1.8 m Copernico telescope) in Asiago, taken soon after the reported hard to soft accretion state transition (ATel #11820, #11823, #11827, #11831, #11833, #11855, #11887). Observations were carried out on four nights between: MJD 58317.860313 (Jul 18 20:38:51.0 UT) and 58318.091458 (Jul 19 02:11:42.0 UT), MJD 58318.906753 (Jul 19 21:45:43.5 UT) and 58319.053264 (Jul 20 01:16:42.0 UT), MJD 58322.893250 (Jul 23 21:26:16.8 UT) and 58322.998957 (Jul 23 23:58:29.9 UT), MJD 58327.871594 (Jul 28 20:55:05.7 UT) and 58327.939637 (Jul 28 22:33:04.6 UT). We retained only the observations with better sky conditions. The average background-subtracted rate of MAXI J1820+070 showed night-to-night variations and was in the range 2300-5700 c/s for IFI+IQUEYE and 35700-39000 c/s for AQUEYE+. The sky background was regularly monitored between on-target observations. The fractional root-mean-square (rms) variability of the 1s binned (non background-subtracted) IFI+IQUEYE light curve was between 2.7% and 4.2%, and that of the AQUEYE+ light curve between 2.7% and 3.8%. The two values are slightly larger than those of a nearby reference star pointed in between on-target observations (1.9-3.8% for IFI+IQUEYE and 2.5-3.0% for AQUEYE+). Power spectra of the non-background subtracted light curves with a time bin of 10 ms were computed for each night and were then averaged over intervals of 130s duration. The power spectra are characterized by low frequency broad-band noise components mostly induced by the sky variability. No significant low frequency quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs) were detected in any of the observations. Using the AQUEYE+ acquisitions of July 18-19, that have the highest background-subtracted source rate, we can constrain the fractional rms of a QPO with properties similar to those detected in April and June (centroid ~100 mHz, width ~20 mHz) to be smaller than ~0.5% (95% confidence)."
395,ATEL #11937,"HBHa 1704-05 was first noted by Kohoutek and Wehmeyer in their catalog of emission line stars (1999, A&AS, 134, 255), as a source with a strong continuum (thus not a PN) and overexposed Halpha emission. It seems not much else is available in literature. The star is coincident with 2MASS J19544295+1722125 (=ASASSN-V J195442.95+172212.6) catalogued by VSX (Otero 2018) as an SR variable with a periodicity around 418 days, and a range of variability 13.2-12.4 in V band. On patrol sky observations obtained with a Canon EOS 1000D plus 180mm focus lens, one of us (R.F.) recently noted a rapid increase in brightness amounting to (preliminary calibrated) V~12.0 on July 31.945 UT, V~11.7 on Aug 3.989, and V~10.7 mag on Aug 8.938. The trend was confirmed by inspection of the on-line ASASSN database. An exploratory spectrum was soon obtained on UT Aug 9.839 by one of us (P.B.) with a 23cm+Lhires III telescope, showing a rich emission line spectrum that prompted to collect deeper observations. On UT Aug 10.837 we have observed HBHa 1704-05 with ANS Collaboration telescope ID 310 obtaining B=11.459, V=10.926, R=10.101, and I=9.199. Comparing with APASS mean values for quiescence, B=13.798 and V=12.637, the object is now 2.3 mag brighter in B and far bluer in color (from B-V=+1.16 to +0.53). A deep 3200-7900 Ang spectrum of HBHa 1704-05 was obtained on UT Aug 10.855 at 2.31 Ang/pix dispersion with the Asiago 1.22m telescope, while the Varese 84cm provided a high resolution Echelle spectrum on UT Aug 10.882. The spectrum of HBHa 1704-05 is characterized by TiO absorption bands from an M giant in the red, progressively veiled by nebular emission toward the blue, with a prominent Balmer continuum in emission. A lot of strong emission lines are present, with HeII 4686 of the same intensity of Hbeta, and [NeV] 3426 suggesting a photo-ionization temperature in excess of 100,000 K. A prominent NIII 4640 complex is accompanied by OIV 3411 and OIII 3313, 3429, and 3444, indicating that pumping under Bowen fluorescence, initiated by HeII Ly-alpha photons at 303.8 Ang, is active. Forbidden lines characterized by a low critical density are absent, and also absent is the Raman scattered OVI pair at 6825, 7088 Ang. On the Echelle spectrum, the emission lines appear remarkably sharp and symmetric, without P-Cyg absorptions or other signatures of mass loss being visible, and with broad wings for the Balmer lines that suggest a large electron pressure. Bowen-pumped OI 8446 is present as are low-excitation emission from FeII multiplet 42, NaI D1,D2 and infrared CaII triplet. We therefore conclude that HBHa 1704-05 is a previously unknown symbiotic binary, currently undergoing an ""hot-type"" outburst, with the wind of the cool giant being increasingly ionized by a hot companion rising in Teff. Its Gaia parallax suggests a distance of 3.6 kpc (albeit with a large error), and Schlafly et al. (2011, ApJ 737, 103) extinction maps indicate a reddening E(B-V)=0.28. The latter is confirmed by the low equivalent width for DIB 6614 and KI 7699. Combining APASS mean BVgri photometry in quiescence with 2MASS JHK data, a spectral type around M3III can be inferred for the M giant, in agreement with M(V)=-1.0 in quiescence from Gaia parallax. The large brightness attended by the ongoing outburst of HBHa 1704-05 and its favorable position on the sky will undoubtedly support a large, all-out observing effort, we plan to join."

The nova has been discovered well before maximum brightness, as shown by the comparison of our BVI photometry for Aug 10 and 11, with that by S.

The equivalent width (E.W.) for interstellar KI 7699 corresponds to E(B-V)=0.94 adopting the calibration of Munari and Zwitter (1997, A&A 318, 269), and the E.W. of DIB 6614 provides E(B-V)=1.01 from Munari (2014, ASPC 490, 183). The E.W. of DIBs at 5780 and 5797 correspond, respectively, to E(B-V)=0.92 and 1.04 applying Kos and Zwitter (2013, ApJ 774, 72) relations. The overall average is E(B-V)=0.98 +/- 0.02. Significant evolution has occurred since the spectral observation by Williams et al. (ATel #11928), primarily a reduction in excitation and in line width and velocity, as usual during the rise to maximum. The HeI lines are gone, and now a greater number of low-excitation emission lines are present over the whole spectral range, all displaying P-Cyg profiles, with the equivalent width of the absorption component rivaling or surpassing the emission one. Lines from a large number of FeII multiplets are present, CaII H and K, near-IR CaII triplet, Balmer and Paschen series, NaI, OI 7772 and 8446 (not yet Bowen pumped). The P-Cyg profiles are now perfectly fitted by a combination of two Gaussians, with no extended wings. The velocity shift from emission of P-Cyg absorptions range now from about -580 km/s for FeII, to -650 for Hbeta, to -710 for OI. The width of emission and absorption components also vary among ions and lines, from 1100 and 760 km/s (respectively) for Hbeta to 730 and 460 km/s for OI."
399,ATEL #11931,"We report recent activity of the micro-quasar V4641 Sgr (= SAX 1819.3–2525). Since the end of 2018 July, MAXI/GSC detected weak, soft enhancement from the position consistent with V4641 Sgr. The average 2-4 keV and 4-10 keV X-ray fluxes on August 1-8 (MJD 58331-58338) are (8.6+/-1.5)e-3 c/s/cm2 (~8 mCrab) and (5.9+/-1.7)e-3 c/s/cm2 (~ 6 mCrab), respectively. The source also showed similar weak (6-10 mCrab) activity from 2018 April 4 to April 10 (MJD 58212-58218). We also note that the source was marginally detected between these two outbursts at a flux level of (1.6+/-0.5)e-3 c/s/cm2 at the 2-4 keV band, suggesting continuous activity of the source since the outburst in April. The source exhibited several weak outbursts after the very bright outburst in 1999. The previous outbursts that MAXI/GSC detected at flux levels of 3 mCrab are in 2010 September (ATel #2785, #2832, #2892), 2012 June (ATel #5803, #5836), 2014 February (ATel #7858, #7874, #7904, #7908, #7966), and 2015 July. No apparent periodicity is found. These data, however suggest that weak outbursts occur at intervals of 500-600 days though an outburst around 2017 December when the source was in an unobservable sky region was not confirmed. Multiwavelength monitoring of the source is encouraged. Recent MAXI observations of V4641 Sgr:  "
400,ATEL #11932,"Three new Fast Radio Burst were detected with the radio telescope BSA LPI of the Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory of the Lebedev Physical Institute (100 km south from Moscow) at the frequency 111 MHz during processing of archival data of scintillation of radio source on inhomogeneities of interplanetary plasma in period from 2012 to 2018. The Radio telescope BSA LPI is meridian-type instrument (200m x 400m) with a central frequency of 111MHz and band width 2.5 MHz. The fluctuation sensitivity is 140 mJy at time resolution 0.1 s. In so doing the time interval between samples is 100 ms. The radio telescope has multibeam diagram consisting of 96 beams. This gives a possibility for continuous monitoring of large area of the sky (from -8.20 to +42.13 degrees by declination). The main goal of data processing was to search for pulses from the repeated FRB 121102. The results are given below: FRB 151018 (01:05:48 2015-10-18 UTC): the pulse has coordinates RA(J2000) = 05:21:00 and DEC(J2000) = +33:06:00. Dispersion measure is 570 pc/cm^3+/-5 pc/cm^3 (DM_Gal=275 pc/cm^3 in accordance with the YMW16 model). A signal-to-noise ratio S/N ~ 6.2. The peak flux density is ~ 1.4 Jy according to our estimates. Width of pulse is ~ 2.5 s. FRB 160920 (03:05:43 2016-09-20 UTC): the pulse has coordinates RA(J2000) = 05:34:00 and DEC(J2000) = +41:45:00. Dispersion measure is 1767 pc/cm^3+/-4 pc/cm^3 (DM_Gal=250 pc/cm^3 in accordance with the YMW16 model). A signal-to-noise ratio S/N ~ 9.1. The peak flux density is ~ 0.22 Jy. Width of pulse is ~ 5 s. FRB 170606 (10:03:27 2017-06-06 UTC): coordinates of pulse are RA(J2000)= 05:34:00 and DEC(J2000)= +41:45:00. Dispersion measure is 247 pc/cm^3+/-5 pc/cm^3. A signal-to-noise ratio S/N ~ 8.3. The peak flux density is ~ 0.54 Jy. Width of pulse is ~ 3.3 s. Each pulse is visible only in one beam of multibeam diagram of BSA LPI. Since the width of the main lobe of the beam pattern of the BSA LPI radio telescope at half the level is ~ 30', these coordinates have comparable error. The coordinates of FRB 151018 coincide with coordinates of the repeated FRB 121102 within the error. Therefore, we can say with a high probability that pulse of known FRB 121102 was detected for the first time at the frequency 111 MHz. From here we can draw a conclusion about the spectral index of the event FRB 121102. Based on our estimates at 111 MHz and earlier measurements at different frequencies the spectral index v ~ -0.6+/-0.4."

404,ATEL #11926,"Y. Nakamura (CBET #4514) on UT 2018 April 29.474 discovered the cataclysmic variable V392 Per to have erupted into a nova, peaking at V~6.2. The nova was immediately detected as a strong gamma-ray source by Fermi-LAT (Li et al. ATel #11590), and three months later as an X-ray source when the Sun-constraint was lifted and the nova could be pointed by Swift (Darnley et al. ATel #11905). On UT Aug. 9.083 we observed Nova V392 Per with the Asiago 67/92cm Schmidt telescope in BVgri bands. Calibration into the APASS photometric system provides B=15.250, V=14.267, g'=14.801, r'=14.000 and i'=13.671, with transformation errors about 0.005 mag in all bands. Simultaneous with the photometric observations, we obtained a deep spectrum of the nova with the Asiago 1.22m telescope, at a dispersion of 2.31 Ang/pix (for a resolving power 1100) and over the wavelength interval 3300-8000 Ang. The mid exposure time was UT Aug 9.061. Compared to spectral observations just before (Tomov et al., ATel #11605) and soon after the Solar conjunction (Darnley, ATel #11846 and #11872), large changes have occoured. The transition to advanced nebular conditions is in place, with [OIII] 4959+5007 now 3.6 times the integrated flux of Halpha+[NII]. All emission lines result now composed by two broad and well separated components (both with a FWHM ~1800 km/sec; exact values range from 1500 to 2000 km/sec depending from the line). The bluer component is now generally the strongest. The velocity separation of these broad components ranges from 3400 km/s for Halpha up to 4500 km/sec for [NeV] 3426 Ang (well matching the FWHM=5200 km/s of the single peaked line profiles observed at the start of the eruption, Wagner et al., ATel #11588). A narrow and low-velocity component is visible in most of the lines, its width unresolved at our instrumental resolution (thus < 200 km/s). The peak intensity of this central, narrow component (Nw) varies greatly from line to line compared to the intensity of the broad components (BC), ranging from Nw >> BC for HeII 4686, to Nw > BC for HeI lines, Nw ~ BC for Balmer lines, Nw << BC for [NeIII], [OIII], [NII], and absent for [NeV]. Such profiles for the emission lines are closely similar to those observed at late stages in the extremely fast and He/N V2672 Nova Oph 2009, modelled by Munari et al. (2011, MNRAS 410, 525) as a bipolar flow aligned with the line of sight plus an equatorial torus seen face-on. The large intensity of Neon lines, in particular [NeV] 3426 comparable in intensity to Halpha+[NII], suggest V392 Per to be a Neon Nova. The integrated flux of the two broad components of [NeV] 3426 is 4.5x10(-13) erg/cm2sec, and 3.5x10(-13) for [NeIII] 3869. The integrated flux of the narrow central peak for [NeIII] 3869 is 1.5x10(-14), or 4% of the broad components. [NeIV] 4715 is probably present too, but too heavily blended with HeII 4686 and the NIII 4640 complex for a reliable detection."
405,ATEL #11927,"The MAXI/GSC nova-alert system (Negoro et al. 2016, PASJ, 68, S1) detected a weak X-ray flux enhancement from the Galactic plane (l,b) = (22.0, 0.0) on 2018-08-06T17:04(UT). Assuming that the source flux was constant over 8 times scan transit (2018-08-07T05:26(UT) to 16:15), we have obtained the source position at (R.A., Dec) = (277.752 deg, -9.630 deg) = (18 31 00, -09 37 48) (J2000) with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short radii of 0.34 deg and 0.31 deg, respectively.

This is the first detection of XTE J1829-098 by MAXI/GSC since August 2009. The MAXI/GSC data shows that the present brightening started from 2018-08-05 (MJD 58335). The daily averaged 4-10 keV flux reached 0.028 +- 0.005 photons/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (24 +- 4 mCrab) on 2018-08-07 (MJD 58337), and slightly decreased to 0.021 +- 0.005 photons/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (18 +- 4 mCrab) on 2018-08-08 (MJD 58338). This X-ray flux variation traces the previous outburst profile, a duration of &sim;7 days (Markwardt et al. 2009, Atel#2007). The 2-10 keV X-ray spectrum integrated over 4 days (MJD 58335-58338) can be described by unabsorbed power-law model with photon index of 0.31<sup>+0.48</sup><sub>-0.52</sub> (90% C.L.), which is consistent with the previous report of &Gamma; = 0.76 +- 0.13 (Halpern et al. 2007, ApJ, 669, 579). The observed luminosity in 2-10 keV energy band is 3.6&times;10<sup>36</sup> (d/10 kpc)<sup>2</sup> erg s<sup>-1</sup>, which is larger than the previous outburst peak luminosity by a factor of &sim;4. Previously, two outburst periodicities were claimed by Halpern et al. 2007 (&sim;1.3yr) and Markwardt et al. 2009 (&sim;246d). The multiple of the above two periods do not match with the time interval between the current brightening and the last outburst in 2009. However if small modifications (a few days) are applied on both periodicities, the time interval becomes multiple of its. Moreover, the time interval is 14 times the modified Markwardt's prediction of &sim;243d (or half of the Halpern's period). Therefore, we can not rule out each periodicity."

409,ATEL #11924,"Transient We report previously-unpublished Director's Discretionary Time XMM-Newton observations of neutron star merger GW170817 (PI: Schartel). This XMM-Newton observation at 162 days post-merger confirms previous Chandra observations of a plateau in the X-ray light curve of GW170817's non-thermal synchrotron afterglow, before its current fading (e.g., Nynka et al., 2018, Alexander et al. 2018). XMM-Newton obtained a 111.5 ks observation of GW170817 (obsID: 0811212701) on 26 January 2018 UT, approximately 162 days post-merger. We extract and fit the X-ray spectrum assuming an absorbed power-law spectral model with fixed NH = 7.5e20 cm^-2. We measure an absorbed flux of f(0.3-8 keV) = 1.7 (+0.6/-0.5) x10^-14 erg/s/cm^2 (all uncertainties are 90% c.l.) and photon index of Gamma = 1.61 (+0.26/-0.24), which corresponds to an unabsorbed luminosity of L(0.3-10 keV) = 4.6 (+1.5/-1.5) x10^39 erg/s assuming a luminosity distance of 42.5 Mpc. Our results from this XMM-Newton observation of GW170817 at 162 days are consistent with our Chandra observations at 159.7 days, which revealed an absorbed flux of f(0.3-8 keV) = 2.06 (+0.34/-0.30) x10^-14 erg/s/cm^2 and Gamma = 1.58 (+0.23/-0.22) (Nynka et al., 2018). A joint spectral fit of both the XMM-Newton observation at 162 days and Chandra observations at 159.7 days gives Gamma = 1.60 (+0.17/-0.17). Previously, XMM-Newton also obtained a 44.2ks DDT observation of GW170817 at 135 days post-merger (PI: Schartel, obsID: 0811210101). From this data, D'Avanzo et al. (2018) measured an unabsorbed flux of f(0.3-10 keV) = 2.1 (+1.1/-0.8) x10^-14 erg/s/cm^2 and Gamma = 1.7 (+0.5/-0.4), which corresponds to an absorbed flux of f(0.3-8 keV) = 1.7 (+1.1/-0.8) x10^-14 erg/s/cm^2. This XMM-Newton flux measurement at 135 days was surprisingly fainter than our previous Chandra measurement at 109.2 days (Ruan et al., 2018), as well our later Chandra measurement at 159.7 days (Nynka et al., 2018), although the uncertainties are large. We provide a independent reanalysis of this XMM-Newton data at 135 days, and find a unabsorbed flux of f(0.3-10 keV) = 2.4 (+1.1/-0.9) x10^-14 erg/s/cm^2 (equivalent to an absorbed flux of 1.9 (+1.7/-0.9) x10^-14 erg/s/cm^2 in the 3-8 keV band) and Gamma = 1.7 (+0.8/-0.6), slightly brighter than previously reported and more consistent with our Chandra observations. Below, we provide a light curve table of all currently-available Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of GW170817. We note that all flux and luminosity measurements are from our own independent analysis of the data (reported here and in Nynka et al., 2018), except for the Chandra observations at 2.3 days, which are rescaled from Margutti et al.

412,ATEL #11918,"4U 1538-52 is a bright eclipsing high-mass X-ray binary containing a neutron star accreting from the wind of QV Nor, a B0Iab star. We calculated the power spectrum of the Swift BAT light curve from the transient monitor program (Krimm et al. 2013, ApJS, 209, 14) covering the energy range 15 - 50 keV, and a time range of MJD 53416 to 58318 (2005-02-15 to 2018-07-19) for periods from 0.07 days to the length of the light curve. The power spectrum is dominated by very strong peaks at the orbital period and its harmonics. However, in addition, we noted a peak near 14.9 days at a height of ~22.5 times the mean power level with a nominal false alarm probability (FAP) of 10^-5. To further investigate this modulation, we removed data within +/- 0.15 in phase of the eclipse center, using the ephemeris of Mukherjee et al. (2006, JApA, 27, 411). From a power spectrum of this modified light curve, the orbital modulation was strongly reduced, and the only significant peak was near 14.9 days at a height ~30 times the local power level with an FAP of ~10^-8. The derived period was 14.916 +/- 0.003 days. We note that this is consistent, within the errors, with four times the orbital period of 3.728382 +/- 0.000011 days. We note that both the candidate superorbital period and the orbital period of 4U 1538-52 are very similar to those of IGR J16418-4532 (Corbet & Krimm, 2013, ApJ, 778:45) where the ratio of superorbital to orbital period is 3.94, and thus would be consistent with the possible correlation between superorbital and orbital periods in wind-accretion HMXBs. To characterize the modulation near 14.9 days in 4U 1538-52 we also made a sine wave fit to the modified light curve. The mean count rate is 0.0055 cts/cm^2/s (approximately 25.3 mCrab) and the sine wave semi-amplitude is 0.00045 +/- 0.00004 cts/cm^2/s, approximately 2.1 mCrab. The epoch of maximum flux is MJD 56106.6 +/- 0.2, which is 0.37 +/- 0.2 days after the time of eclipse center. We note that because of the exact ratio between the candidate superorbital period and orbital period and the phasing, we are not measuring the flux at the implied maximum or minimum of the modulation. We are not aware of any artifact that would cause modulation at four times the orbital period and aligned with the eclipse. We investigated the power spectra of BAT light curves of other eclipsing supergiant HMXBs without already known superorbital periods for similar modulation, and did not see any. Observations at other wavelengths over the proposed superorbital period are encouraged."

Aligning these images to ground-based imaging of AT2018cow at peak brightness, we clearly detect the transient source in all four bands. From these images, we find that the transient had brightness (Vega mag): F218W = 19.3 +/- 0.1 mag F225W = 19.2 +/- 0.1 mag F275W = 18.9 +/- 0.1 mag F336W = 19.1 +/- 0.1 mag Additional HST/WFC3 imaging is scheduled."

417,ATEL #11915,"We report on follow-up optical photometric (MASTER Global Robotic Network) and spectral observations (1.9-m SAAO) of the nearby changing look AGN NGC 1566, which was discovered to be in outburst in hard X-rays by the INTEGRAL observatory on 2018 June 12-19 (Ducci et al., ATel #11754), and was then investigated with the Swift observatory (Kuin et al. ATel #11786, Grupe and Komossa ATel #11903). An ASAS-SN V-band light curve for the period 2014-2018 (Dai et al., ATel #11893) shows that nuclear the outburst became visible in September 2017. The 2014-2018 mid-infrared light curves of the object for show that the nucleus brightened by one magnitude at 3.4 microns and 1.4 magnitudes at 4.6 microns between January 2017 and July 2018 (Cutry et al., ATel #11913). In the past the object spent much time in a low-luminosity state where the broad permitted lines were nearly undetectable (Alloin et al. 1986, ApJ 308, 23). It had several recurrent brightening events when its type changed from Sy 1.9-Sy 1.8 to Sy 1.5-Sy 1.2 states (Phillips et al. 1992, ApJ 308, 23). Our MASTER data include old unfiltered archival data from 2014, new special intensive monitoring in the B,V bands, as well as unfiltered W band data starting in the beginning of July 2018. We show the light curve (<a href="" "">here</a>) for unfiltered data reduced to the V-band system of ASAS-SN. As it is seen from the light curve, our magnitudes are in a good agreement with the ASAS-SN V-band light curve for 2014-2018. From our data a slow linear decline after the maximum at the beginning of July is clearly seen. The brightening in the beginning of ASAS-SN light curve in 2014-2015 is due to a supernova (SN), but is not seen in our data as our aperture excluded the SN. Analysis of the Swift/XRT data demonstrates a substantial increase of flux by 1.5 orders of magnitude accompanying the brightening in the UV and optical bands (<a href="" "">here</a>). Low resolution optical spectra were obtained on 2 August 2018 with the SAAO 1.9-m telescope. The spectra reveal a dramatic strengthening of the broad emission lines compared to past published ones. This confirms NGC 1566 to be a changing look Seyfert galaxy. Furthermore: 1. H-beta is quite a lot brighter than [OIII]5007A. The H-beta to N1 line ratio is about 2-2.5, corresponding to a Sy1.2 classification. H-beta has not been observed at this strength before in this object. 2. The HeII4686A is bright and broad. No such strong HeII was visible in the past published spectra (see e.g. Kriss et al., 1991, ApJ 377, L13; Winkler 1992, MNRAS 257, 677). 3. The [FeX]6374A coronal emission line is stronger than [OI]6300A, something that has not been seen before in NGC 1566. We are going to present more details in our next publications."

Light curve of DDE 158 obtained with the same T17 telescope starting from June 2018 is shown at   This object was discovered with the tip of the pen based on its unprecedented (NUV-W1) color index of 8.9 (see Denisenko and Larin, 2018, <a href="" "">arXiv:1807.04574</a>). The position of DDE 158 on the color-color diagram of cataclysmic variables (NUV-W1) vs (W1-W2) is shown at   with the dark blue triangle. (FUV-NUV) value is 0.28. At the distance of 103+/-1 parsec (Gaia DR2) DDE 158 is in Top 20 nearby cataclysmic variables ranked 16th. With the absolute magnitude M=11.1 at quiescence and M=10.3 in outburst is was categorized as ""micronova"" because of a small outburst amplitude compared to dwarf novae. This subtype of compact binary systems has obviously a low accretion rate. T. Maccarone in Cataclysmic Variables discussion group has suggested that DDE 158 and Larin 2 are objects with the wind-fed accretion where wind circularization radius is smaller than the Roche Lobe overflow circularization radius. The tomography of spectral lines is required to verify whether the accretion disk is present before, during and after the outburst. Since the orbital period is unknown, the time-resolved photometry is also strongly encouraged. Based on the outburst recurrence time from the long-term light curves, the next chance to study this object will occur no earlier than in spring 2019. Another thing to note is the light curve behavior of DDE 158 before the current outburst. One can detect the ""pumping-up"" phenomenon similar to that observed during the supercycle of ER UMa-type variables. Every next outburst in the cycle has a larger amplitude and a longer duration than the previous one (16.4m on June 11, 16.3 on June 25, 16.2 on July 14). The dip before the current outburst is clearly detected, even despite the gap in observations on July 27-31 due to bad weather in Australia. Continued monitoring of this unusual object from other longitudes is strongly recommended. New Variable Stars by D. Denisenko:  "

424,ATEL #11913,"NEOWISE (Mainzer et al. 2014, ApJ, 792, 30) has observed the Seyfert 1.5 galaxy NGC 1566 every six months beginning in January 2014. During each measurement epoch, NEOWISE acquired 30 to 47 separate 7.7 sec exposures covering the object over the span of three to five days. The mid-infrared light curves ( ) of the object show that the nucleus brightened by one magnitude at 3.4 microns and 1.4 magnitudes at 4.6 microns between January 2017 and July 2018. Elevated levels of X-ray emission from the nucleus of NGC 1566 were reported in June 2018 (ATel #11754, #11783). An ASAS-SN V-band light curve (ATel #11893) shows the nuclear outburst began to be visible in September 2017. The rise in the mid-infrared flux between July 2017 and January 2018 is consistent with the better-sampled V-band light curve. The amplitude of the outburst in the mid-infrared is considerably larger than in the V-band, but that may be a result of less dilution by stellar emission at the longer wavelengths. The mid-infrared light curves also show evidence for small amplitude variations prior to the start of the outburst, with maxima on or before January 2014 and between January and July 2016. The 8.25 arcsec radius aperture mid-infrared measurements do not appear to be influenced by supernova ASASSN-14ha (ATel #6460, #6461, #6480; Valenti et al. 2016, MNRAS, 459, 3939) in September 2014 that was just outside of the measurement aperture. However, the supernova is detected in a difference image formed by subtracting NEOWISE January 2014 data from January 2015 data. The NEOWISE light curves of the nucleus are based on fluxes measured in an 8.25 arcsec radius aperture relative to a sky reference brightness measured in an annular region with inner and outer radii of 50 and 70 arcsec, respectively. Measurements from exposures that may be corrupted by image smearing caused by spacecraft jitter are excluded.

427,ATEL #11905,"Transient The known dwarf nova V392 Per underwent its first detected classical nova eruption on or shortly before 2018 April 29 (<a href="" "">CBAT</a>). Subsequently, the eruption has been followed extensively in the optical from the ground (see ATel #11588, #11590, #11594, #11601, #11605, #11617, #11647, #11846 and #11872, <a href="" "">ARAS</a>, and <a href="" "">Darnley & Starrfield 2018</a> for further details).

During the 1.6 ks observation on Jul 20y, the Swift XRT recorded a count rate of 0.060 &plusmn; 0.006 count/sec. The X-ray spectrum could be fitted with a single temperature optically thin component, with very little column (N<sub>H</sub>): kT = 2.8 +3.1/-0.8 keV and N<sub>H</sub> < 7&times;10<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;cm<sup>-2</sup>. However, adding a soft component does improve the fit at the ~99% confidence level, which gives: APEC kT = 0.53 +0.23/-0.14 keV, atmosphere kT > 42 eV and a much higher N<sub>H</sub> of (3.0 &plusmn; 0.5)&times;10<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;cm<sup>-2</sup>. Alternatively, a similar fit could be obtained with 2 APEC components. Eleven ksec of Swift XRT data were obtained across 2018 July 26 and 27. With the additional statistics from this longer exposure time, the spectrum is better fitted with three temperature components: either three APECs or two APECs and a soft model atmosphere component. Given that we might expect super-soft source emission to be modelled with an atmosphere component, we present this fit here: APEC kT1 = 0.29 +0.10/-0.07 keV; APEC kT2 > 13 keV; atmosphere kT < 57 eV; N<sub>H</sub> = (1.9 &plusmn; 0.3)&times;10<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;cm<sup>-2<sup>.

428,ATEL #11907,"The MAXI/GSC nova alert system triggered on a bright X-ray source at 22:05 UT on 2018 August 2. The spectrum of this scan transit was well reproduced by an absorbed blackbody model with a temperature of kT = 1.9 (+0.4, -0.3) keV (90% CL) and the hydrogen column density was 4.8 (-4.3, 7.2)x 10<sup>22</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> (90% CL). The averaged X-ray flux in 2 - 10 keV band was 8.6(-1.4,+1.3) x 10<sup>-9</sup>ergs/cm<sup>2</sup>/s (90% CL). On the basis of the fitting results, this transient is probably a type-I X-ray burst. Since the emission was detected only for a fraction of the triangular transit response, the uncertainty of its position along the scan direction is large. Without assuming the source constancy, we obtain a rectangular error box (90%C.L.) with the following corners: (R.A., Dec) = (259.522, -39.888) deg = (17 18 05, -39 53 15) (J2000) (R.A., Dec) = (259.363, -39.845) deg = (17 17 27, -39 50 40) (J2000) (R.A., Dec) = (259.378, -42.084) deg = (17 17 30, -42 05 00) (J2000) (R.A., Dec) = (259.543, -42.127) deg = (17 18 10, -42 07 35) (J2000). The source was not detected significantly in the previous transit at 8/2 20:40 and in the next transit at 8/2 23:44 UT with an upper limit of 20 mCrab for each. Since LMXB RX J1718.4-4029 located in the error region of the transient, we suggest that the transient is a type-I X-ray burst from RX J1718.4-4029 or a new source (we tentatively name the source MAXI J1718-409)."
429,ATEL #11906,"Observations, AGN, Quasar, Transient We report discovery of an X-ray transient in recent (2018 July 26, 31) Chandra observations targeting the James Webb Space Telescope North Ecliptic Pole Time Domain Field (JWST NEP-TDF). JWST NEP-TDF is a JWST Guaranteed Time Observer program (PI: Windhorst) with multi-epoch visits planned promptly after JWST launch (Jansen & Windhorst, arXiv:1807.05278). NEP-TDF has exceptional advantages for time domain science and early universe science with JWST due to its low IR background, lack of IR-bright interlopers, and location in the JWST continuous viewing zone. We are in the process of developing a deep multi-wavelength dataset to complement future observations and set a baseline for post-launch time domain science. To date, three ~50-ks epochs of the associated 900-ks multi-cycle Chandra campaign have been observed. The source was marginally detected (~13 net 0.3-8 keV counts; SNR~2.3) over 2018 April 11-13 (obsids 21072, 21073, 20363). On 2018 July 26, we detected the source at SNR~9.5, with an increase in count rate by a factor of ~7 (neglecting modest corrections due to changes in vignetting and PSF). By 2018 July 31, the count rate had decayed by ~25% (variability SNR~2.3). Spectral fits of both July detections are consistent with an absorbed power law (nH~2e22/cm^2, Gamma~2, ~4e-14 cgs flux (0.3-8 keV)). The location (RA, Dec)=(17:24:21.72, +65:48:47.3) is consistent with SDSS J172421.74+654847.5 (ugriz=[20.89,20.73,20.45,20.28,20.58]). Pre-flare GALEX and SDSS photometry (Richards et al, 2009, ApJS, 180, 67) indicate that the SDSS counterpart is likely a quasar at z~1.1 (1.0-1.6) but UV/O/IR host spectroscopy is currently unavailable. This interpretation is consistent with WISE W1,2,3 colors. For a flare at z~1.1, the X-ray luminosity is Lx~3e44 erg/s and we infer Lbol>10^45 erg/s based on pre-flare photometry. A redshift of z~1.44 is permitted and would place the source at a mere ~3.5 Mpc from NLSy1/FSRQ VCS5 J172314.1+654746, near the center of the field. Subaru HEROES giz photometry (PI: Hasinger) from 2017 July indicates brightening by (0.54,0.23,0.67) over SDSS magnitudes. No radio source is evident from our deep (rms~micro-Jy) pre-flare 3GHz VLA data. This flare is strong for an AGN, and could indicate an accretion state change (e.g. a changing look quasar). A z>1 changing look quasar would be exceptional for its distance, would constrain the X-ray flare onset to <50 days (rest-frame), and would permit monitoring of several rest-frame UV transitions from the ground. At 10' from the NEP-TDF center, it is outside the planned JWST GTO program (r~NIRCAM<7', r~NIRISS<5') but would be well-situated for JWST GO observations with pure parallels that deepen or expand the GTO field. We are planning multi-wavelength follow-up observations and encourage additional follow-up. O/IR spectroscopy is particularly needed to confirm the redshift and nature of the optical counterpart, and in anticipation of continued monitoring. Given the pre-flare SDSS magnitudes, such follow-up should be possible from a wide variety of telescopes."

431,ATEL #11903,"We report on follow-up Swift observations of the nearby Seyfert 1.5 galaxy NGC 1566 (Dai et al., ATel #11893) which was discovered in an outburst in hard X-rays by Integral on 2018-June-12-19 (Ducci et al., ATel #11754). Swift observations immediately after this discovery showed that the X-ray flux in the XRT had significantly increased (Ferrigno et al., ATel #11783) as well as in the UV (Kuin et al., ATel #11786). The most recent Swift observations from July 10, 17, 24, and 31 confirm the high X-ray and UV flux states, but may indicate that the peak of the outburst was reached around July 10. The current flux in the 0.3-10 keV band is (6.79+/-0.19)e-14 W/m2 which corresponds to a 0.3-10 keV luminosity of 3e35 W assuming a distance of 20 Mpc. The enhanced X-ray position (Goad et al. 2007; Evans et al. 2009) at RA-2000 = 04 20 00.37, Dec-2000=-54 56 16.6 (uncertainty 1.4"") corresponds to the optical position of the center of the galaxy. Our Swift UVOT observation on 2018-July-31 was performed in the filters V, B, U, W1, and W2. Compared with the 2007 observation we found the following magnitudes: V: 13.49, 13.01 (2007, 2018); B: 14.40, 13.40; U: 14.18, 12.59; W1: 14.50, 12.48; W2: 15.09, 12.60 (note that the extraction radius was 5 arcsec, and that the host galaxy significantly contributes to the magnitudes at low-state). The W2 magnitude is slightly lower than that reported by Kuin et al. (ATel #11786). The uncertainties of all these observations are typically of the order of 0.04 mag and the values given here are not corrected for Galactic reddening. The reddening however in the direction of NGC 1566 is low with E(B-V) = 0.008 mag. We would like to thank Brad Cenko for approving our ToO request and the Swift team for performing the observations. We continue monitoring this AGN with Swift."
432,ATEL #11898,"We observed again the optical afterglow of the bright, low-redshift GRB 180728A (Starling et al., GCN 23046; Lipunov et al., GCB 23048; Rossi et al., GCB 23055) with the ESO VLT UT2 equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph. Observations were carried out around July 30.21 UT (35.5 hr after the GRB). In our observations, the afterglow has faded significantly compared to our previous observation (Rossi et al., GCN 23055), reaching a magnitude of R ~ 20 (Vega). Continuum is detected across the whole observed range 3000-25000 AA, despite at lower S/N. Weak emission lines from a faint host are now visible, corresponding to H&alpha;, H&beta;, [N II], [O III] 5008 at the GRB redshift. The small Balmer decrement is consistent with negligible dust extinction in the host galaxy. After excluding the host emission lines and correcting for Galactic extinction, the observed continuum can be fit with a single power-law with spectral index ~ 0.6 (F_nu~nu^-beta). In particular, we do not see evidence in any of our spectra for broad undulations or deviations from a power-law behavior as reported by Buckley et al. (ATel 11897).

433,ATEL #11899,"We are regularly collecting spectra and BVRI photometry of MAXI 1820+070 with the Asiago 1.22m, 1.82m and Schmidt 67/92 telescopes, and ANS Collaboration telescope ID 2300. These observations are performed in coordination with optical timing observations carried out by the AQUEYE+IQUEYE Collaboration (ATel #11723, #11824). MAXI 1820+070 is a bright and uncatalogued X-ray transient source first detected on 2018 March 11 by Kawamuro et al. (ATel #11399) and then identified with the optical transient ASASSN-18ey (ATel #11400, #11403, #11404, #11406). The source was soon proposed to be a candidate black hole X-ray binary by Baglio et al. (ATel #11418). A massive multi-wavelength observational effort is currently underway worldwide as indicated by the large number of ATel issued on this source so far. The source recently underwent a hard to soft accretion state transition (ATel #11820, #11823, #11827, #11831, #11833, #11855, #11887). Here we describe the detection of changes in recent optical spectra of MAXI 1820+070 taken after the reported hard to soft accretion state transition. The observations have been obtained with the Asiago 1.22m telescope, at 2.31 Ang/pix dispersion over the 3300-8000 Ang range. The most recent observing dates have been centered on UT July 19.872, 23.883, 25.915, 27.878, 29.863 and 30.886. On all these dates the spectra are similar, with a strong blue continuum and superimposed broad emission lines (with an average FWHM of 1100 km/s) of - primarily - the Balmer series of hydrogen, HeII 4686 and 5412 Ang, various HeI, and the 4640 complex by NIII. On July 19 and 23 spectra, the Balmer emission lines appear single peaked and broadly Gaussian in shape. On July 25 the Balmer lines begin to show a hint of a double peaked profile, that matures into two components separated by about 850 km/s on July 27, and retrace back to just a double peaked profile by July 29, and finally to a single component by July 30. HeI and HeII lines show equivalent transitions between single/double profiles, apparently not in phase with those displayed by Balmer lines but with a similar velocity separation.

434,ATEL #11900,"We obtained 22-GHz VLBI observations of AT2018cow with the NRAO VLBA and Effelsberg telescopes. The midpoint of the observations was 2018 July 8.1 UT. We detect the source with a total flux density of ~5 mJy. We obtain a preliminary position of RA = 16h 16m 00.2242s, dec = 22d 16' 04.890"" with an estimated uncertainty of 60 micro-arcsec. Our position is more accurate than the previously reported one from e-MERLIN (Atel #11819) but only 3.2 milliarcsecond different, and therefore consistent within the estimated uncertainties. The position is based that of the phase-reference source, JVAS J1619+2247."
435,ATEL #11901,"The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME;  ) is a transit radio telescope consisting of four 20m x 100m cylindrical reflectors oriented North/South, plus a powerful F-X correlator, located at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory near Penticton, British Columbia, Canada. The CHIME Fast Radio Burst (FRB) Project (CHIME/FRB Collaboration, ApJ, in press, arXiv:1803.11235) forms 1024 independent stationary intensity beams with 1-ms time sampling and 16k frequency channels over a range of 400 - 800 MHz. CHIME/FRB is a uniquely fast survey instrument that can search for FRBs over an instantaneous field of view of ~200 square degrees in real time. During its ongoing commissioning CHIME/FRB detected FRB 180725A on 2018 July 25 at 17:59:43.115 UTC (topocentric, at 400 MHz). The automated pipeline triggered the recording to disk of ~20 seconds of buffered raw intensity data around the time of the FRB. The event had an approximate width of 2 ms and was found at dispersion measure 716.6 pc/cm^3 with a signal-to-noise ratio S/N ~20.6 in one beam and 19.4 in a neighbouring beam. The centres of these, approximately 0.5 deg wide and circular beams, were at RA, Dec = (06:13:54.7, +67:04:00.1; J2000) and RA, Dec = (06:12:53.1, +67:03:59.1; J2000). However, precise localisation of the source and a flux estimate await further commissioning and calibration. The expected maximum Galactic line-of-sight dispersion measure in the source's direction is 69 pc/cm^3 (from the NE2001 model) or 81 pc/cm^3 (from the YMW16 model). The observed DM is far in excess of these values, even after accounting for the systematic uncertainties in the Galactic-DM models, confirming the identification of this event as an FRB. The event is clearly detected at frequencies as low as 580 MHz and represents the first detection of an FRB at radio frequencies below 700 MHz. The de-dispersed frequency versus time plots for both beams can be found at the link below. Some frequency channels with terrestrial radio frequency interference have been zero-weighted. We do not find compelling evidence of scattering in the burst profile, and we caution against over-interpreting the band-limited structure of the pulse spectrum, as the data have not been corrected for frequency-dependent beam sensitivity. Further observations to search for repeated bursts at all wavelengths are encouraged. Link to plot: <a href=' '>FRB 180725A</a> ' ' Additional FRBs have been found since FRB 180725A and some have flux at frequencies as low as 400 MHz. These events have occurred during both the day and night and their arrival times are not correlated with known on-site activities or other known sources of terrestrial RFI. We acknowledge local support from the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory and also support from our funding agencies (for a full list please see arXiv:1803.11235). Footnote: We have named this event appending an upper-case letter, in alphabetical order corresponding to confirmed event number on the specified date. However, this approach is temporary and we look forward to discussing a sustainable convention with other FRB-detection experiments."

437,ATEL #11897,"We report on SALT spectroscopy of the optical counterpart to GRB180728A, which was discovered by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Starling et al., GCN#23046) and for which an optical transient was detected by the MASTER-SAAO transient detection facility (Lipunov et al., GCN#23048, GCN#23050) and spectra obtained by the ESO VLT UT2 using X-Shooter (Rossi et al., GCN#23055). A 1600 s exposure spectrum was obtained with the SALT Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS) on 2018 July 28 at 21:43:21 UT (mid exposure time) using the 300 l/mm grating covering 3900-9000&#8491; at an average resolving power of R = 350. We attempted a spectroscopic classification with the SNID code (Blondin & Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024), with the best match being a SN Type Ic, five days before maximum, at a redshift of z=0.042, although the match is quite poor. While the major humps in the continuum occur close to their predicted wavelengths, there are significant flux residuals. We clearly detect both the rest frame interstellar Ca II 3933/3970&#8491; and Na I 5890/5896&#8491 doublets. Two absorption features seen at 4393 & 4434&#8491; are identified as the Ca II doublet at a redshift of z = 0.117, consistent with the determination of Rossi et al.(GCN#23055). Simultaneous optical photometry with the SAAO 1-m telescope using the high-speed SHOC EM-CCD camera in white-light showed GRB180728A to only slowly fade over the period 00:46 to 02:47 UT, by approximately half a magnitude.

443,ATEL #11890,"We use archival Chandra and NuSTAR observations to discuss the X-ray counterpart of IGR J16181-5407, a persistent but still unidentified source seen by INTEGRAL/IBIS (Bird et al. 2016, ApJS, 223, 15). Within the IBIS positional uncertainty one bright and hard X-ray source was detected (Landi et al. 2012, ATel #4233) but no unambiguous optical counterpart was found. Chandra pointed at the region of this source on 2017-05-20, with an exposure time of 5 ks (Obs. Id. 18975) and was able to locate the source (RA(J2000)=16:18:07.73, Dec(J2000)=-54:06:12.14) with an uncertainty of only 2 arcsec, allowing us to pinpoint a single optical/IR object: USNO-B1.0 0358-0591923/2MASSJ 16180771-5406122, also listed in the ALL-WISE catalogue with colours W1-W2=1.176 and W2-W3=2.566, i.e. typical of AGNs (Secrest et al. 2015, ApJS, 221, 12). The source spectrum is absorbed (N<sub>H</sub>~10<sup>23</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>) and bright (0.3-10 keV flux=3x10<sup>-12</sup> ergs cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). This source was also observed by NuSTAR on 2017-01-29 (Obs. Id. 30161006002), with a net exposure time of 59 ks, as part of the Galactic Legacy Survey. The NuSTAR spectrum is well fitted by an absorbed power law (Chi^2/dof=192/171), with positive residuals around 6 keV suggesting the presence of a Fe K alpha emission line. Adding a narrow Gaussian line improves the fit (Delta Chi^2 of -15 for 2 dof less; the probability of chance improvement is 0.001 from an F-test). The equivalent width of the line is 100+/-50 eV, and its energy (observer's frame) is 5.85+\-0.15 keV. If interpreted as the neutral Fe K alpha line at 6.4 keV, it would indicate a redshift of 0.085+/-0.015. Finally, we measure a photon index Gamma=1.69+/-0.08 and an absorbing column density of (8+/-2)x10<sup>22</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> . The extrapolated 0.3-10 keV flux is 4x10<sup>-12</sup> ergs cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, while the extrapolated 20-100 keV flux is 1.2x10<sup>-11</sup> ergs cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (a factor of 1.5 larger than the IBIS flux). We encourage multiwavelength observations of this source to confirm its extragalactic nature."
444,ATEL #11891,"The Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) Unbiased Transient Survey (NUTS; ATel #8992) reports the spectroscopic classification of ATLAS18sld/SN 2018ebt. The candidate was discovered by ATLAS (Atel #11727) on UT 2018-07-21 11:52:48 at 15.58 mag (orange-ATLAS). The spectroscopic observation was performed with the 2.56 m Nordic Optical Telescope equipped with ALFOSC (range 350-950 nm; resolution 1.6 nm FWHM). Survey Name | IAU Name | Discovery (UT) | Discovery mag | Observation (UT) | Redshift | Type | Phase ATLAS18sld | SN 2018ebt | 2018-07-21.50 | 15.58 | 2018-07-24.06 | <~0.02-0.03 | likely Ic-BL. | pre-/near peak Classification was performed using the SNID (Blondin and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) and GELATO (Harutyunyan et al. 2008, A&A, 488, 383) tools. The closest matches are SNe Ic-BL (e.g., 2012ap, 2006aj) with phases at a few days before the peak or around the peak, and the redshifts from these matches are uncertain, generally between 0.02 - 0.03 or less. There are also some matches with other SNe Ib/Ic. The most recent ATLAS observation (15.20 +/- 0.04 mag at MJD = 58324.50) shows that the SN is brighter than at discovery, and the light curve indicates that it might be approaching the peak, which is consistent with the estimated spectroscopic phase based on SNID/GELATO. At z ~ 0.02 - 0.03, the latest ATLAS measurement would indicate an absolute magnitude M_o ~ -20 - -21 (assuming that Galactic extinction A_o is similar to A_R = 0.6 from NED), while the redshift could be lower and then the object would be less luminous. Note that ATLAS18sld/SN 2018ebt was classified by Masayuki Yamanaka as a SN Ib/c at z=0.005 using the spectrum taken by 1.5-m Kanata telescope/HOWPol on UT 2018-07-23 13:47:51. Spectral lines from the host galaxy will be needed to pin down the SN redshift/distance and its absolute magnitude. ATLAS18sld/SN 2018ebt is about 14'' away from the center of a faint galaxy GALEXASC J204152.80+641238.5 (unknown redshift). Given the apparent magnitude of the host (r=17.0 from PanSTARRS), and taking the largest plausible value for the distance (z=0.03), the host galaxy is likely fainter than r~-19.1. The relatively large separation from the center of its probable may indicate a low-metallicity environment. Further follow-up observations are encouraged."

446,ATEL #11887,"Following reports of rapid X-ray spectral softening and a hard-to-soft state transition (e.g. ATels #11820, #11823), we observed MAXI J1820+070 / ASASSN-18ey (e.g. ATels #11399, #11400, #11418, #11420) with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) on 2018 July 7, 10, 11 and 13. Each observation was 48 min in duration, centred at or near transit, preceded by a 10-min scan of the calibrator 3C295. The MJDs corresponding to the on-source times for the target are 58306.935-58306.969, 58309.927-58309.961, 58310.935-58310.968 and 58312.935-58312.968. Similar to our previous LOFAR observation and detection of this source (ATel #11609), these high-band (115-189 MHz) observations were reduced with the Prefactor calibration pipeline (e.g. van Weeren et al. 2016, ApJS, 223, 2). A very preliminary reduction with a restricted bandwidth (115-158 MHz) yielded an average angular resolution of about 38"" x 22"" (average beam position angle 10 deg east of north), and RMS noise levels between 2.4 and 4.9 mJy/beam. MAXI J1820+070 / ASASSN-18ey is detected at the 5.5 sigma level in our first observation, but more marginally in the remaining runs (flux density of peak pixel = 3.0-4.8 x RMS). The flux densities of the target at a central frequency of 136.5 MHz are 27.1 +/- 5.6, 12.0 +/- 3.0, 11.5 +/- 2.7 and 14.7 +/- 5.1 mJy on July 7, 10, 11 and 13, respectively. In all cases, the quoted flux density is that of the peak pixel; uncertainties were calculated by combining the RMS and a 10 per cent calibration error in quadrature. The flux density scale is that of Scaife & Heald 2012 (MNRAS, 423, L30). Further direction-dependent calibration is planned, which will reduce the noise level. A 15.5-GHz Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA) observation of this source was taken at the same time as our July 7 observation (ATel #11827), with a flux density of approximately 1.5 mJy. The instantaneous two-point spectral index, alpha, between 136.5 MHz and 15.5 GHz (flux density S<sub>nu</sub> proportional to nu<sup>alpha</sup>) is therefore approximately -0.6 for MJD 58306.935-58306.969, consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission. This spectral index, as well as our low-frequency light curve, suggests that we are observing the decay of the radio flare seen on July 6/7 (ATel #11827), which followed jet quenching on July 5/6 (ATels #11827, #11831; also see ATel #11833). A further LOFAR observation took place on July 20 (MJD 58319.900-58319.933), which is still to be reduced at the time of writing, and our final run is scheduled to take place on July 27 (MJD 58326), again centred at or near transit. We thank the ASTRON Radio Observatory, particularly Roberto Pizzo and Matthijs van der Wiel, for promptly scheduling our LOFAR observations and pre-processing the data."
447,ATEL #11883,"Nucita et al. (ATel #11882) reported that the light curve of the microlensing event <a href="" "">TCP J18010186-2951258</a> (ATel #11853) shows deviations from the single lens model that could be interpreted as a signature of the binary lens with the mass ratio q = 8.3e-3. <p/> This event is located in the field BLG513 that is regularly monitored by the <a href="" "">OGLE-IV Survey</a>. The archival 22-year-long light curve of the source reveals semi-regular low-amplitude variability that is typical of OGLE small amplitude red giants. The strongest pulsation period is 155.4 d, but the light curve shows additional modulation on timescales of 10-20 d. Although the amplitude of variability in the baseline is small (0.03 mag or 3% of the flux in the I band), it is magnified by a factor ~30 during the microlensing event. <p/> Deviations from the single lens model in the light curve of TCP J18010186-2951258 are likely caused by the variability of the source star, not by the binarity of the lens."
448,ATEL #11884,"During the recently recommenced Galactic Plane Scan program (PI: Dr A. Bazzano), the IBIS/ISGRI instruments onboard the INTEGRAL observatory observed a clear re-brightening of MAXI J1535-571, a bright black hole candidate in a low-mass X-ray binary (Y Xu et al. 2012 ApJ, 852, 2). MAXI J1535-571 was first detected by Swift and MAXI in outburst in early September 2017 (GCN #21792, ATel #10699) where it reached ~5 Crab in the MAXI/GSC band, making it one of the brightest black hole binary candidates observed. The source was detected by IBIS/ISGRI during scans performed early in revolution 1979 (between 2018-07-22 00:28:13 and 2018-07-23 11:11:35) and was observed to be brightening strongly. In the analysis of the stacked data from the revolution, IBIS/ISGRI data detected the source at RA = 233.851, Dec = -57.240, 3' error radius, and with an overall detection significance in the 22-60 keV band of 8.6 sigma. The flux was measured in the 22-60 keV as 1.72 +/- 0.2^-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (15.89 +/- 1.84 mCrab), with an effective exposure time of 5.2 ks. Further Galactic Plane Scan observations are due in the coming days and we will continue to monitor this source. Other observations to observe the developing outburst in all wavelengths are strongly encouraged. INTEGRAL Galactic Plane Scanning: Keeping watch over our Galaxy:  "

450,ATEL #11886,"The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, has observed enhanced gamma-ray emission from a source positionally consistent with the Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) CGRaBS J1933+6540, also known as TXS 1933+655, with coordinates R.A. = 293.4889050 deg, Decl. = 65.6713411 deg (J2000; Beasley et al. 2002 ApJS 141, 13), at redshift, z=1.687 (Healey et al. 2008 ApJS 175, 97). This source is not in any published LAT catalog and was not detected by AGILE or EGRET. Preliminary analysis indicates that this source went into a high-flux state on 2018 July 23, with a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (0.6+/-0.1) x 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainties only; single power-law photon index of 2.3+/-0.2), with a peak 6-hr flux from 12:00-18:00 UTC of (1.0+/-0.3) x 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1. Because Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring of this source will continue. We encourage further multifrequency observations of this source.

Kojima on UT 2018 07 13.494 and the ASAS-SN Sky Patrol light curve (Shappee et al. 2014; Kochanek et al. 2017) resembles that of a microlensing event (Subo Dong et al. ATel #11853).

Hence, including all currently (and free) archival V band data (AAVSO, and ASAS-SN) together with a few newly remotely acquired data using iTelescope.Net instruments (T17) n Siding Spring, Australia, ( ) we find a best fit solution with a binary lens model with parameters q= 8.3E-3, b=0.66, t_0=113.8 (HJD-2458200), t_E= 19.5 days, u_0=0.027, theta = 2.63 radians, V_0 = 14.5. Subsequent analysis on the characteristics of the lens system parameters and the background source is in progress with the aim to test other possible models (including blending and finite source effects), check the robustness of the solution, confirm the binary lens model and, if so, refine the best fit parameters.

453,ATEL #11881,"The black hole candidate X-ray transient MAXI J1727-203 was discovered on 2018 June 5 (Yoneyama et al., ATEL#11683). The source quickly made a transition to a soft or intermediate state (Negoro et al., ATEL#11696). NICER measurements on June 5th showed a thermal component with kT near 0.2 keV along with a power-law component with a photon index near Gamma = 2.5 (Ludlam et al., ATEL#11689). A Swift/XRT measurement on June 7th (Kennea et al., ATEL#11697) showed a similar photon index but a hotter thermal component (kT = 0.46+/-0.01 keV). The highest flux reported was 3.9e-9 erg/cm2/s (0.5-10 keV, absorbed) from the Swift/XRT observation (ATEL#11697). Based on an inspection of the MAXI light curve and our analysis of Swift/XRT observations on June 9, 13, and 16, kT peaked near 0.56+/-0.01 keV, and the 0.5-10 keV absorbed flux peaked near 7.3e-9 erg/cm2/s (based on the June 13 measurements). The Swift/XRT monitoring restarted in mid-July, and observations were made on July 10, 13, 16, 19, and 22. The observation on June 16 had no usable data due to a mispointing of the satellite, but we analyzed the data from the other four observations. We modeled the 0.5-10 keV spectra with an absorbed disk-blackbody plus power-law model. The column density measurements ranged from (3.6+/-1.1)e21 atoms/cm2 to (5.2+/-0.6)e21 atoms/cm2. On July 10, the disk temperature was 0.18+/-0.01 keV, and it was 0.14-0.15 keV for the other three observations (July 13, 19, and 22). A gradual hardening of the power-law photon index is observed: Gamma = 2.04+/-0.06 (July 10), Gamma = 1.97+/-0.06 (July 13), Gamma = 1.85+0.07-0.03 (July 19), and Gamma = 1.75+/-0.08 (July 22). Over the same time, the 0.5-10 keV absorbed flux drops from 1.37e-9 erg/cm2/s to 6.1e-10 erg/cm2/s. The change in the photon index shows that the source is entering or has entered the hard state. A NuSTAR TOO has been approved for the coming week and is being scheduled. It will most likely occur on July 24 or 27. See   for updates on the schedule. Coordinated observations are encouraged."
454,ATEL #11878,"We report on high-resolution optical spectroscopy of ASASSN-18pe which was reported as a possible cataclysmic variable on a slow rise to eruption by Strader et al. (2018, ATel #11867). We obtained a 1200 s spectrum of this object under the SALT Large Science Program on transients on 2018 July 19.2 (HJD 2458319.2), using the High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS; Crause et al. 2014, Proc. SPIE, 91476) mounted on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). Observations were taken in the LR mode of HRS, covering a spectral range of 3800-8900 &#8491; at a resolution of R = 14000. The data were reduced with the SALT HRS MIDAS pipeline (Kniazev et al. 2016, MNRAS 459, 3068). The spectrum shows a very blue continuum with a strong He II emission at 4686#8491 characterised by a single emission peak, a FWHM ~ 180 &plusmn; 10 km/s, and a heliocentric corrected Vr ~ 115 &plusmn; 5 km/s. The other lines of the Pickering series at 4542&#8491 and 5412&#8491 are also present in emission showing a similar Vr but are much weaker. Halpha also shows an emission feature characterised by a FWHM ~ 150 &plusmn; 10 km/s and Vr ~ 95 &plusmn; 5 km/s. The flux ratio of (He II/Halpha) is around 2.3. Hbeta shows a weak emission feature superimposed on a relatively broad absorption feature (FWHM ~ 1300 &plusmn; 200 km/s). The emission feature might be associated with He II at 4859&#8491. Hgamma is also present in absorption. We also identify weak emission lines of He I at 6678&#8491 and 7065&#8491 with Vr ~ 115 km/s and H I at 8598&#8491, 8665&#8491, and 8750&#8491 with Vr between 160 and 180 km/s. The EW of the Na I D interstellar absorption doublet is consistent with a relatively low extinction towards the source (Av ~ 0.2) in fair agreement with the Galactic Extinction maps. The unusually strong He II 4686 emission and the photometric behaviour reported in ATels #11867 and #11875 are worth further investigation."

456,ATEL #11874,"On 12th Luly 2018 the FSRQ PKS 0035-252 (z=0.498), triggered our HE monitor of FERMI-LAT data at E > 10 GeV with TS ~49 (see, Pacciani et al. 2014, ApJ, 790, 45 for a description of the method), showing a power-law gamma-ray spectrum exceeding 40 GeV in the satellite frame (see also the ATel #11854 by the Fermi-LAT collaboration on 14th July 2018). We obtained 3 follow-up observations with Swift starting on 13th July 2018. The source showed the brightest optical and X-ray flux ever detected with The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, With a peak flux reached on the last pointing on 18th July 2018. On 16th July 2018, the source was observed twice within 6 hours and showed a variability of 25% with all optical/nuv filters (2 nearby sources where used as reference). On 18th July 2018 the source was observed for a reduced time, and with the W2 only filter. The magnitude (Vega system) was: 14.30+-0.02 (stat error only) and The x-ray flux was (5.+-1)*10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.3-10 KeV). On 16th July 2018, the photometry (Vega sytem) was: VV: 14.85 +- 0.03 UU: 14.61 +- 0.03 W1: 14.51 +- 0.02 M2: 14.46 +- 0.02 W2: 14.59 +- 0.02 (stat error only). The simultaneous Swift-XRT observation gives a counting rate of cps. The X-ray spectrum was fitted with an absorbed power-law, with unabsorbed flux: (5.4+-+-0.4)10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1, and photon index: 1.30+-0.26 (0.3-10keV).

457,ATEL #11875,"We have obtained UBVRI photometry (Landolt system) and optical spectroscopy of recently discovered ASASSN-18pe currently undergoing a large amplitude outburst (Atel #11867). Photometry was obtained on UT July 19.888 with the ANS Collaboration telescope 1205 (42cm) providing B=13.961, V=13.895, R=13.801, and I=13.678, with total error budgets (including transformation from the instantaneous local photometric system to the reference Landolt equatorial standards) less than 0.01 mag in all bands. We also obtain U=13.27, but with a larger uncertainty considering the sea level altitude of the observing site. This indicates a continuing (and slow) rise in brightness of ASASSN-18pe, that was reported in Atel #11867 at V=14.3 two days earlier. The overall color seems somewhat bluer that the SLOAN griz values listed for quiescence in the Pan-STARRS release 1 (PS1) Survey Absolute optical spectrophotometry was obtained with the Asiago 1.22m telescope at 2.31 Ang/pix over the 3250-7950 Ang range on UT Jul 19.853. The spectrum rises steeply toward the short wavelengths in agreement with the blue photometric colors. Hbeta, gamma, delta, epsilon lines stands in clear absorption although with a minimal equivalent width, H9 being the highest Hydrogen line before those further up merge into the Balmer continuum in absorption. NaI 5890, 5896 doublet is also in clear absorption. Only an emission component is visible in Halpha with an integrated flux of 6.6 (+/- 0.6) x 10(-15) erg/cm2 sec. The strongest emission line is HeII 4686, radiating an integrated flux of 1.34 (+/-0.11) x 10(-14) erg/cm2 sec, twice larger than Halpha (both lines single peaked). No evident emission line from HeI is visible, with the possible exception of a feeble 5876 Ang. The radial velocity for all observable lines is pretty low within the limited sensitivity of the adopted spectral dispersion. Overall, the photometric and spectral appearances are compatible with a CV eruption. Worth noticing are the slow rising time (commented upon also in Atel #11867), the unusual strength of HeII emission and the possibly bluer colors compared to quiescence."
458,ATEL #11876,"The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory made an XRT photon counting mode exposure of the candidate tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2018dyb (Pan et al. 2018, ATEL #11865) starting on 2018 July 18 at 14:04:51 UT, for a net exposure of 2.98 ks. No source is detected at the location of AT2018dyb. A standard extraction circle with a radius of 20 pixels finds 10 events; background regions of equivalent size find a similar number of events. Assuming a kT = 0.2 keV blackbody spectrum as typical of TDEs, Galactic absorption of 2.0 E+21 cm^-2, 10 total photons in 2.98 ks equates to a flux of F < 7 E-14 erg/cm^2/s in the 0.3-10 keV band.

460,ATEL #11869,"GRS 1739-278 is a black hole candidate that was first detected in outburst in 1996 (Paul et al., 1996). This outburst lasted ~11 months. In 2014 March it experienced a new outburst (Krimm et al., 2014). The main 2014 outburst of GRS 1739-278 lasted for ~1.2 years and was subsequently followed (see Yan & Yu, 2017a) by several rebrightenings (which are episodes of increase in the flux after the end of the main outburst although they never reach a maximum flux similar to that during the peak of the main outburst). After the final Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory/X-ray Telescope (Swift/XRT) observation reported by Yan & Yu (2017a), Swift continued to monitor the source, albeit less frequently than before. In February 2017 the source was still detected although at a low level (Yan & Yu, 2017b; ATel #10137). We requested observations using the Swift/XRT to establish the source activity level ~1.25 years after the end of the last reported observation by Yan & Yu (2017b; ATel #10137). Our observation of 2018 May indicated that the source was still active at a low level having a (0.5-10 keV) count rate of ~0.6 c/s. We requested more XRT observations to confirm and follow the current activity status of the source. Our first follow-up observation was performed on 2018 July 18 and the source was detected at a very similar count rate level as during the 2018 May observation. We analysed the source spectra extracted from our two currently available XRT observations by fitting an absorbed power-law model. We fixed the equivalent hydrogen column density to Nh = 2.5E22 cm<sup>-2</sup> (Yan & Yu, 2017a). The fits indicated a photon index &Gamma; = 1.6 +/- 0.3 which suggests that the source is in the so-called black hole hard state. The unabsorbed flux is ~5E-11 erg/cm<sup>2</sup>/s (0.5-10 keV) which corresponds to an unabsorbed luminosity of ~4E35 erg/s (0.5-10 keV, assuming a distance of 7.5 kpc; Yan & Yu, 2017a). This is similar to the flux level of the 2017 February observation reported in ATel #10137. We found that the source was in the field-of-view of several XRT pointings between February 2017 and our newly requested observations and the source was consistently detected at very similar fluxes. Therefore, it appears that the source has been in a quasi-steady state for about ~1.5 years now. The current quasi-steady state is not representative of the quiescent level of the source since a pre-outburst XRT observation, observed on 2012 May 13, did not detect the source. The (0.5-10 keV) count rate upper limit derived from this observation is <4E-2 c/s (using the 90% prescription by Gehrels, 1986), which is a factor of >15 lower than the count rate we detected in our recent XRT observations. Such a quasi-steady low level state is unusual for black-hole X-ray transients. Multi-wavelength observations are necessary in order to get more insight into the physical process(es) at work during this state. We will continue to monitor the source using the XRT once every month until it is Sun constrained in 2018 November. We thank the Swift team for scheduling our observations.

461,ATEL #11870,"In 2018 July 17.772 UT, we registered the onset of a strong outburst which reached maximum brightness of 11.7 mag in the Rc band. It was brighter then the outburst on 2014 July 26 that was recorded as the most brightest in our search (ATel #6347, #6355, #6364, #6385).The observations were performed with the 25-cm telescope and electronic tube equipped by a microchannel plate. The outburst continued more than 6 hours. The last estimate Rc = 12.6 was made on 18.022 UT, the star was far from a quiescent state. Like the previous registered giant outburst, the new one happened in an eclipse, the orbital phases were between 0.95 and 0.97. The precession period phase was 0.17 relative to T3 moment of maximum divergence of relativistic emission components. We have obtained the spectrum with the SAO 1-m telescope and UAGS spectrograph on July 17.83 UT with the signal accumulation of 4800 s, just in the maximum light. Spectral range was 3900 - 7850 &Aring;, resolution was 6 &Aring;. The H&alpha; line has FWHM = 18 &Aring;, what is typical for the quiescent state, FWZI = 93 &Aring;, and EW = 300 &Aring;. The He I emission lines are also typical for quiescence. However, the He II 4686 &Aring; emission line is very bright and wide, so it forms common band with the Bowen blend and the He I 4713 &Aring; line having FWHM = 78 &Aring; and EW = 160 &Aring;. We identified short-wavelength relativistic components of H and He I. Such a spectral behavior differs from the outburst of 2014 July 26 when the H&alpha; line profile had a wide pedestal. SS 433 was observed with the RATAN-600 radio telescope at 2-30 GHz on 2018 July 17.86 UT in the frame of the long-term monitoring of the microquasars (Trushkin et al., 2017). After three weeks of quiet state, fluxes increased by two-three times during a day reaching 1.1 Jy at 4.7 GHz. Spectral index was -0.47, what is the usual value in the outbursts.

462,ATEL #11871,"Fermi GBM triggered on 2 bright SGR-like bursts on 2018 July 5th (GCN #22905). The two bursts were separated by 19 minutes, and locate to the same area in the sky, indicating a common origin. The 3 sigma contour of the first and brightest burst location encompass 2 known magnetars, CXOU J171405.7-381031 (Takuro et al. 2010) and 1RXS J170849.0-400910 (Israel et al. 1999). The latter is monitored by XRT with 1 observation every 20 days on average. We analyzed the first (and currently only) XRT observation of 1RXS J170849.0-400910 that is taken after the GBM triggers (obsID 00035318161, observation date 2018 July 17). We find an absorption corrected 0.5-10 keV flux of about (3.6\pm0.4)e-10 erg/s/cm2. This flux level is a factor 2 to 3 brighter than its historic flux (Campana et al. 2007, Scholz et al. 2014). We also analyzed three Swift XRT observations from the source taken prior to the 2 GBM bursts (obs IDs 00035318157, 00035318159, 00035318160), the last of which was taken on 2018 June 27. We fit all spectra simultaneously and find that the 3 observations prior to the GBM triggers are consistent with the same flux level of about (2.0\pm0.2)e-10 erg/s/cm2, 80% dimmer than the current value from the source. We conclude that the brightening in the magnetar 1RXS J170849.0-400910 is likely real and took place subsequent to June 27. Further, the brightening is accompanied by a marginal hardening of the spectrum. Given the location of the 2 bursts in the sky and the contemporaneous detection of X-ray brightening from 1RXS J170849.0-400910, we conclude that these 2 events are likely associated. We note that such bright bursts, if indeed related to 1RXS J170849.0-400910, are detected from this magnetar for the first time (see also ATEL#10107). We strongly encourage X-ray and multi-wavelength follow-up observations of the source to cover its first reported outburst."
463,ATEL #11872,"Here we report that the 2018 classical nova eruption from the known dwarf nova V392 Per has apparently entered the post-nova eruption nebular phase (see, ATel #11588, #11590, #11594, #11601, #11605, #11617, #11647, #11846 for further details; also see <a href="" "">CBAT</a>, <a href="" "">ARAS</a>, and <a href="" "">Darnley & Starrfield 2018</a>). Unlike the our previous LT spectra (ATel #11601 and #11846), this spectrum was taken with the SPRAT instrument on the LT (R~350). This new spectrum, as with the previous, show Balmer emission from H&alpha; - H&delta; and an array of He I lines. However, these lines have now been joined by extremely strong [O III] lines at 4363, 4959 and 5007 &#8491;, and He II (4686 &#8491;). The [O III] (5007) line rivals H&alpha; in brightness; [O III] (4363) and He II (4686) are stronger than H&beta;. The [O III] lines are double-peaked, whereas the H I, He I, and He II lines retain the triple peaked structure reported in ATel #11846, the width of the [O III] lines are consistent with those of H I. The first Swift observations of this system are imminent, we strongly encourage follow-up observations, particularly high-resolution optical spectroscopy."

465,ATEL #11866,"We obtained a spectrum of classical nova candidate PNV J00420765+4119438 (see <a href="" "">CBAT TOCP</a> and ATel #11849) with the SPRAT spectrograph (resolution R~350; <a href="" "">Piascik et al. 2014</a>) on the 2-m Liverpool Telescope (<a href="" "">Steele et al. 2004</a>) on 2018 July 14.09 UT. A spectrum of PNV J00425261+4118409 (ATel #11856) was taken on 2018 July 16.17 UT. Both spectra show strong Balmer emission lines (H&alpha; to H&delta;). The FWHM of the H&alpha; emission line is ~2700 km/s for PNV J00420765+4119438 and ~850 km/s for PNV J00425261+4118409. The spectrum of PNV J00420765+4119438 also shows Fe II emission lines (multiple 42), along with possibly O I (7773 &#8491;). The continuum of PNV J00420765+4119438 is relatively flat. Other than Balmer emission, PNV J00425261+4118409 exhibits a featureless but blue continuum. We conclude that both PNV J00420765+4119438 and PNV J00425261+4118409 are classical nova eruptions in M31. PNV J00420765+4119438 likely belongs to the Fe II taxonomic class, whereas PNV J00425261+4118409 was probably caught during the final rise or around peak luminosity.

466,ATEL #11867,"We report the discovery of ASASSN-18pe, a new Galactic transient at J2000 coordinates of R.A.=17:15:21.54, Dec. = +06:00:27.2 . The source first appeared on 2018 July 10 with V=15.8 and has been rising steadily since then, reaching V=14.3 on 2018 July 17. ASAS-SN shows no previous variable or transient source at this location. The PS1 photometry for the source (Chambers et al 2016, arXiv:1612.05560) implies a mean quiescent mag of V~18.2, so a rise of at least 3.9 mag from quiescence so far and a total rise time of > 1 week. A link to the current ASAS-SN Sky Patrol light curve can be found below. We obtained a 300 s optical spectrum with SPRAT on the Liverpool Telescope on 2018 July 17.9. While of modest signal-to-noise in the lines, the R~350 spectrum shows a blue continuum, with Hbeta, Hgamma, and perhaps Hdelta in absorption at z~0. No Halpha absorption is seen, perhaps because it is filled in by emission. There may be HeII 4686 in broad (possibly double-peaked) emission, but it is only weakly detected. We also observed the source with Swift/XRT for 1 ksec on 2018 July 17.7. ASASSN-18pe was clearly detected but faint, with 13 events. A basic spectral analysis gives an X-ray flux of 5(-3/+7)e-13 erg/s/cm^2 (0.5-10 keV) for a power-law fit with a photon index of 2.5(1.0) and N_H = 5.8e20 cm^-2. This flux gives an X-ray luminosity of 6e31(d/kpc)^2 erg/s. A second Swift observation is planned for July 22. The optical spectrum and probable low X-ray luminosity would normally suggest that the most likely explanation for ASASSN-18pe is a dwarf nova rising to outburst. However, the slow rise is unusual for a dwarf nova (e.g., Szkody & Mattei 1984, PASP, 96, 988). The rare systems with slow rises, such as GK Per, are generally interpreted to have long orbital periods and evolved secondaries (e.g., Crampton et al. 1986, ApJ, 300, 788). The modest foreground extinction (likely no more than A_V ~ 0.5) and faint quiescent magnitude would imply a distance of at least a few kpc if the secondary is evolved, in turn implying an X-ray luminosity of ~> 5e32 erg/s. We emphasize that, while several aspects of the transient resemble a dwarf nova, the slow rise time and possible high luminosity suggest that other, more exotic possibilities, such as an unusual X-ray binary outburst, should be considered. Additional observations, including higher-resolution optical spectroscopy, are encouraged. ASAS-SN Sky Patrol light curve:  "

We also measured the near-infrared magnitudes as J=15.6, H=15.4, and Ks=14.9 on Jul 24.5. The optical light curves show almost linearly decline until Jul 1, and the short plateau stage between Jul 1 and 10. After that, the optical luminosity rapidly fades, again. We measured the ~17.2, ~17.2, and ~16.8 magnitudes in V, R, and I bands on Jul 10.5, respectively.

469,ATEL #11863,"I report constraints on the possible progenitor of the LMC Nova ASASSN-18pf, based on Magellanic Cloud Photometric Survey (MCPS; Zaritsky et al. 1997) archival data. There is a counterpart source located at coordinates: R.A.=85.44513 deg. and Dec.=-71.80994 deg. or 2.5 arc seconds away from the reported ASAS-SN position: R.A.=05:41:46.461; Dec.=-71:48:37.59. Taking into account the pixel scale of the ASAS-SN cameras (8""/pixel), both sources are identical within the positional uncertainty. The source has the following magnitudes: B=21.537+/-0.119; V=21.105+/-0.096; I=20.806+/-0.216. The extinction in the direction of the transient was estimated utilizing the LMC Extinction Retrieval Service at the MCPS data products section website ( ). Using all the stars within 10 arc minutes search radius (1689 objects) Av=0.6+/-0.45 was estimated. Hence, taking into account the distance modulus to the LMC (m-M)0=18.515+/-0.085 mag (Clementini et al. 2003) the following extinction corrected colors are obtained: (B-V)0=0.25+/-0.21; (V-I)0=-0.011+/-0.554, along with absolute magnitude of the object: V0=2.0+/-0.5. According to Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018 (Gaia Data Release 2; see their Figure 1) the object should be present in both Gaia data releases, but probably it is not reliably detected due to crowding. The calculated extinction corrected colors and absolute V band magnitude of the archival object are consistent with a FOIII - F5III star at the distance of the LMC. This object probably is the donor star of the binary system. Taking into account the MCPS data, the amplitude of the outburst is ~8.3+/-0.1 magnitudes in V band at the moment of the approximate maximum."

No previous outbursts are detected at the position of ASASSN-18pf since ASAS-SN started observing this location in May 2014. Follow-up observations, especially spectroscopy, are strongly encouraged.

Dispersions range from 600 (Alpy600 and low resolution instruments) to 12000 (eShel and LHIRES) between 3700 and 7900A. Signal to noise values range from ~20 to >80. The low resolution spectra displayed little overall change in the spectrum since the observations reported in (ATel #11802). The Balmer lines remain the dominant emission with absorption troughs (and red wings) extending to about -2300 km/s (minimum around -2000 km/s) and narrow absorption at around -900 km/s, the emission profiles were slightly stronger on the blue side. The Halpha to Hbeta emission ratio was about 5 on Jul 14.8. Echelle observations show that the Na I D broad emission appeared between Jul 6.8 and Jul. 7.8 (ATel #11826) and was still present on the Jul 14.8 echelle spectrum, the detached absorption broad absorption features, discernible even at low resolution, are now at -1800 km/s and -1000 km/s but have weakened relative to Jul 7. He I 5876, 6678 show persistent detached absorption at -1800 km/s and no emission. Fe II 4923, 5018 (partly blended in absorption with He I), 5169 all show the same broad absorption components but these appear to be slightly shifted (-1700 km/s,-900 to -1000 km/s) and possibly fragmenting relative to the earlier report. The Fe II emission profiles are show increasingly strong double peaked structure (-460,+670 km/s) with red wings as extended as those of the Balmer and Na I D emission lines. The Si II 6347,6371 lines are now undetectable. No [O I] or forbidden Fe-peak lines have appeared, additional neutral C and O lines are detectable throughout this period (e.g. O I 7773) and the nova remains in the optically thick stage of the expansion, and with the exception of the rapid onset and persistence of the sodium emission, the nova closely resembles the early stages of the Fe-curtain.

481,ATEL #11853,"The transient <a href= >TCP J18010186-2951258</a> was first discovered by T. Kojima on UT 2018 07 13.494. The <a href= >ASAS-SN Sky Patrol light curve </a> (Shappee et al. 2014; Kochanek et al. 2017) suggested this to be a probable microlensing event. We take i-band follow-up images with 40cm robotic telescopes of the Las Cumbres Observatory, and the refined coordinates based on the follow-up observations are: (RA = 18:01:01.84 Dec=-29:51:23.8). ASAS-SN has been regularly observing the field containing TCP J18010186-2951258 since 2016-03-10. The latest ASAS-SN photometry on UT 2018-07-14.1132905 shows that the source is at V = 10.73, and this is brighter than all previous ASAS-SN measurements. The light curve is consistent with single-lens microlensing models. Since we only have the rising part of the light curve, and due to the degeneracy of blending, there are a number of single-lens microlensing models compatible with data. One possible (though not unique) class of microlensing models expect the event reaching high peak magnification on around UT 2018 07 15 (<a href= >see an example model here</a>). A high-magnification microlensing event is sensitive to planets orbiting the lens star, and high-cadence photometric follow ups are encouraged in the near future.

482,ATEL #11854,"The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of the two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, has observed renewed gamma-ray flaring activity from a source positionally consistent with the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 0035-282, also known as 3FGL J0038.0-2501 (Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23), with coordinates R.A. = 9.5613975 deg, Decl. = -24.9839542 deg (J2000; Beasley et al. 2002 ApJS, 141, 13), and redshift z=0.49806 (Jones et al. 2009, MNRAS, 399, 683). Preliminary analysis indicates that this source went into a high-flux state starting on 30 June 2018, and brightened over the following weeks, reaching a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (1.6+/-0.2) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty only) on 13 July 2018. The latter corresponds to a flux increase of a factor of more than 120 relative to the average flux reported in the third Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL). This is the highest LAT daily flux ever observed for this source, exceeding that observed during a previous flaring episode in November 2017, reported in ATel #10951. The corresponding photon index is 2.2+/-0.1, and is consistent with the 3FGL value of 2.4+/-0.1 within the uncertainties. Because Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring of this source will continue. This source is being added to the ""LAT Monitored Sources"" and consequently, a preliminary estimation of the daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi-LAT will be publicly available ( ). We encourage further multifrequency observations of this source. For this source, the Fermi-LAT contact person is Janeth Valverde (valverde@llr.in2p3.fr). The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden."
483,ATEL #11852,ATel #11851 incorrectly reported the detection time of FRB 180714. The burst was detected on 2018-07-14 at 10:00:08.7 UTC (2018-07-14.416767). We apologise for the mistake.
484,ATEL #11851,"The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (<a href="" "">Manchester et al. 2013</a>) project monitors pulse times of arrival for 24 millisecond pulsars in the Galaxy on a fortnightly cadence. Since 2017 June, we have been commensally searching for fast radio bursts (FRBs) when timing pulsars with the 13-beam 20-cm multibeam receiver. These data are recorded with standard instrumentation (<a href="" "">Keith et al., MNRAS, 2010</a>) and searched in real time for FRBs using the Heimdall software (<a href="" "">Barsdell et al. 2011</a>). On 2018-08-07 at 10:08:42.7 UTC (2018-07-10.4227164352), we detected a burst with a signal to noise ratio (S/N) of 22, at the dispersion measure (DM) of 1469.873 pc cm<sup>-3</sup>, in the field of the millisecond pulsar PSR J1744-1134 (DM = 3.14 pc cm<sup>-3</sup>). The burst was detected in beam 7 of the receiver, which at the time was pointed at a position of (RA, DEC = 17:46:12, -11:45:47; J2000). The burst width (full width at half maximum) was 1 ms and its inferred fluence was 5 Jy ms if at the centre of beam 7. We note that the location of the burst within the telescope beam is highly uncertain (> 0.25 deg); consequently, the fluence measurement is biased low (<a href="" "">Macquart & Ekers 2017</a>). This position is approximately 8.7 degrees off of the galactic plane. The galactic contribution is estimated to be 257 pc cm<sup>-3</sup> from the NE2001 model (<a href="" "">Cordes & Lazio, 2001</a>) and 223 pc cm<sup>-3</sup> from the YMW16 model (<a href="" "">Yao et al. 2017</a>).

A spectrum of PNV J00414889+4109148 (see <a href="" "">CBAT TOCP</a> and ATel #11807) was taken on 2018 July 07.18 UT. Both spectra show strong Balmer emission lines (H&alpha; to H&delta;) and both also show the three emission lines from multiplet 42 of Fe II. The FWHM of the H&alpha; emission line is ~1200 km/s for PNV J00424144+4117377 and ~1500 km/s for PNV J00414889+4109148. PNV J00414889+4109148 also shows tentative evidence for the presence of Fe II (multiple 48, 49, and 74) emission lines, along with possibly O I (7773 &#8491;). We conclude that both PNV J00424144+4117377 and PNV J00414889+4109148 are classical nova eruptions in M31 and that they likely belong to the Fe II taxonomic class.

The spectrum was collected with the FRODOSpec (<a href="" "">Barnsley et al. 2012</a> instrument on the LT on 2018 July 13.21 UT. We utilised the low resolution mode (R=2600, blue arm 3900-5700&#8491; - R=2200, red arm 5800-9400&#8491;) of FRODOSpec, with an integration time of 3&times;180s for both arms. The spectrum was collected at a high airmass (>2), may have suffered from acquisition issues, and there was some thin cirrus around. As such, the throughput in the blue arm of the spectrum was very poor, therefore we only report on the red arm (in which the S/N was also low). Only three emission lines are visible in the red arm, H&alpha;, and He I (6678 and 7065&#8491;). The profile of all three lines are similar, but they are all remarkably different from those reported in ATel #11601. The line profiles show a narrow (~50 km/s) and bright emission spike at approximately the rest wavelength of each line, bracketed on either side by fainter but broad emission bumps. For H&alpha;, the blueward and redward bumps are shifted by ~&plusmn;1750 km/s and have a FWHM of ~1600 km/s. The blueward bump is ~2/3 the height of the redward bump (which is ~half the height of the central narrow peak). As V392 Per exits the Sun, follow-up observations, particularly spectroscopy, are strongly encouraged. The first of a series of Swift observations are planned to begin on 2018 July 20."

489,ATEL #11844,"Photometry obtained by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN; Shappee et al. 2014, ApJ, 788, 48; Kochanek et al. 2017, PASP, 129, 104502) reveals that in mid-May, the intermediate polar FO Aquarii (FO Aqr) faded by 0.4 mag in the g band, consistent with a decrease in the binary's mass-transfer rate. In the linked figure, we plot the 124 g-band observations obtained by ASAS-SN between 2018 April 17-June 29, along with the best-fit sigmoid step-function model. Because FO Aqr has several large-amplitude, short-period variations in its light curve, the ASAS-SN points show considerable scatter with respect to the model; still, the fading behavior is readily apparent. Although FO Aqr remained mired in its 2017 low state as it approached solar conjunction in 2018 January, the presence of a bright state during April and early May establishes that the 2018 faint state is not a continuation of the 2017 event. FO Aqr has now experienced separate low states in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Prior to 2016, it had never been observed in one, despite a nearly century-long observational record (e.g., Garnavich & Szkody 1988, PASP, 100, 1522). The 0.4-mag depth of the 2018 low state is considerably less than its counterparts in 2016 (~2 mag; Littlefield et al. 2016, ApJ, 833, 93) and 2017 (~1 mag; Littlefield et al., in prep.). Nevertheless, Lomb-Scargle periodograms of our time-series photometry of the 2018 low state --- obtained with the University of Notre Dame's 80-cm Sarah L. Krizmanich Telescope and co-author Hambsch's 40-cm optimized Dall-Kirkham telescope --- show greatly elevated power at the spin-orbit beat frequency when compared with the system's high-state power spectrum (Kennedy et al. 2016, MNRAS, 459, 3622), a change that was also present throughout both the 2016 and 2017 low states (Littlefield et al., in prep.). The observed power spectrum implies a direct interaction between the white dwarf's magnetosphere and the accretion flow (Ferrario & Wickramasinghe 1999, MNRAS, 309, 517). The high state in early 2018 was unusually faint by FO Aqr's historical standards. In ASAS-SN V-band photometry from 2013, 2014, and 2015, the system's average magnitude was stable at V = 13.57 +/- 0.01. By contrast, in a high state sandwiched between the 2016 and 2017 fading episodes, the average magnitude was V = 13.74 +/- 0.02, and during the bright interlude in early 2018, it was just V = 13.92 +/- 0.04. Thus, FO Aqr's high states are becoming progressively fainter, suggesting that even after a fading event has concluded, the system's mass-transfer rate does not return to its original level.

490,ATEL #11839,"The AZTEC (Arizona Transient Exploration and Characterization) collaboration reports an optical spectrum of AT2018dfg obtained on UT 2018 Jul 11.12 (JD 2458310.61) with the Magellan Clay telescope (+ LDSS3 spectrograph, VPH-all grism). The spectrum reveals an unresolved narrow H-alpha emission line with a velocity of 475 km/s, and an intermediate H-alpha emission line with a velocity of ~2000 km/s. A similar profile is seen in H-beta. There are also strong Na ID absorption lines associated with the host galaxy, suggesting high local extinction. The narrow and intermediate emission lines, considerable extinction, and redshift of NGC 5468 (0.00948 from NED) indicates that AT2018dfg is likely a IIn SNe, although other types of CSM interacting SNe cannot be ruled out. Cross-correlation using GELATO (Harutyunyan et al., 2008, A&A, 488, 383) finds a good match with the IIn SN 1998S 3.5 days post explosion."

494,ATEL #11843,"Following the detection of hard X-ray emission from AT2018cow by NuSTAR and INTEGRAL (ATels #11775, #11788), INTEGRAL continued observations of the source, accumulating in total 902&nbsp;ks between 2018-06-22 14:54:18 and 2018-07-08 06:42:28 (satellite orbits 1968 to 1973). In the second part of the observation, from 2018-06-30 14:30:56 to 2018-07-08 06:42:28 (satellite orbits from 1971 to 1973), with a total on-source time of 390&nbsp;ks we do not detect the source, putting an upper limit of 1.5&times;10<sup>-11</sup>&nbsp;erg&nbsp;cm<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> in 20-40 keV and 2.5&times;10<sup>-11</sup>&nbsp;erg&nbsp;cm<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> in 40-80 keV energy range (5 sigma confidence). This non-detection is consistent with the evolution following t<sup>-1</sup> starting from 2018-06-16 10:35:02 (ATel #11727), similar to that observed by NuSTAR (ATel #11775) at lower energy (see <a href="" "">Figure</a>). We note marginal evidence deviations from the t<sup>-1</sup> decay, close in time to the flux increase found in Swift/XRT (ATel #11801). The upper limit in this epoch is also consistent with the spectrum measured by NuSTAR at 2018-07-02 14:01:09 (ATel #11813). The combined spectrum extracted from the NuSTAR observation and an integrated IBIS/ISGRI spectrum (giving upper limits) can be fitted by a single powerlaw with a slope of 1.4+/-0.02 (1 sigma error), with reduced Chi<sup>2</sup> of 1.4 for 105 d.o.f (see <a href="" "">Figure</a>). Between 2018-06-22 18:26:58 and 2018-07-08 05:58:39 INTEGRAL/IBIS/ISGRI has observed AT2018cow for 68% of the time, providing an opportunity for an exhaustive search for any short bursts associated with the source. We do not detect any such events on time scales of 1 s and 10 s. We put an upper limit (3 sigma) on the fluence of 1.3&times;10<sup>-8</sup> &nbsp;erg&nbsp;cm<sup>-2</sup> and 3.6&times;10<sup>-8</sup>&nbsp;erg&nbsp;cm<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> in the 20-80 keV energy range (assuming a powerlaw with a slope of -2). Finally, we have searched for any impulsive GRB-like events in the observations of INTEGRAL's all-sky monitors (SPI-ACS and IBIS/Veto, IBIS/ISGRI & IBIS/PICsIT). For this analysis, we have chosen the time interval from 2018-06-12 02:27:53 UTC to 2018-06-17 01:02:50 (INTEGRAL orbits 1964 and 1965). This interval includes the last non-detection of the AT2018cow on 2018-06-13 (ATeL #11738). During this time interval the source position was observable for 88% of time, but the sensitivity of the INTEGRAL all-sky monitors to any impulsive events from the position of AT2018cow was changing, within one of the two positions. In the first case (58% of time), the orientation was close to optimal for the SPI-ACS, reasonably suitable for IBIS/ISGRI and IBIS/PICsIT, but not suitable for IBIS/Veto. The rest of the time, the INTEGRAL pointing direction implied suppressed response of all instruments except for IBIS/Veto. We identify two events which we classify as likely GRBs, at UTC 2018-06-12 18:50:09 and 2018-06-15 11:05:57. Both events are detected in SPI-ACS and IBIS/Veto, when INTEGRAL orientation had an implied suppressed response of IBIS/Veto to any GRBs from the direction of AT2018cow, allowing us to disfavors association of these events with AT2018cow. We, therefore, estimate a typical 3-sigma fluence upper limit in the whole time interval of 5&times;10<sup>-7</sup>&nbsp;erg&nbsp;cm<sup>-2</sup> at a time scale of 1 sec and 12&times;10<sup>-7</sup>&nbsp;erg&nbsp;cm<sup>-2</sup> at the 8-sec time scale."
495,ATEL #11836,"The Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) Unbiased Transient Survey (NUTS; ATel #8992) reports an update on the spectroscopic follow-up of SN 2018cow (ATel #11727). The latest observation with the 2.56 m Nordic Optical Telescope equipped with ALFOSC (range 350-950 nm; resolution 1.4 nm FWHM) was performed on UT July 08.03. The transient spectrum is still dominated by a blue continuum (T_BB~13000 K). A number of broad shallow emission lines are now emerging. After removal of the blue continuum, we tentatively attribute all these emissions to He, namely HeI (447.1, 492.2, 501.5, 587.6, 667.8 and 706.5 nm) and He II (468.6 nm) transitions. The FWHM of the emission identified as He I 5876A is about 7000 km/s. From a narrow, unresolved H-alpha line visible in the spectrum, we estimate a redshift of z = 0.0136 (this value is very close to SDSS redshift, 0.01406, for the parent galaxy). Given this redshift, the peaks of the broad emissions, if correctly identified as He lines, appear significantly redshifted (up to ~70A) with respect to the rest frame position. Formally, we should define SN 2008cow as a Type Ib supernova, although this event shows an unprecedented spectrum for a supernova of this class."
496,ATEL #11837,"We report optical spectroscopic observation of supernova candidates ASASSN-18ll/2018cdh (ATel #11686) and ASASSN-18od/2018dda (ATel #11832) using OSMOS (range 398-686 nm) mounted on the MDM 2.4m telescope at KPNO. Both targets were discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN, Shappee et al. 2014). ASASSN-18ll was observed on 2018-06-17.28 and 2018-07-06.23 with MDM/OSMOS. The spectrum on 2018-06-17.28 shows narrow P-Cygni profiles of HeI (velocity ~1100 km/s) without any presence of broad emission features. This is consistent with several SNe Ibn (e.g. SN 2010al and PTF12ldy) near maximum. The later spectrum obtained on 2018-07-06.23 does not show any prominent P-Cygni profiles, but only weak emission line of HeI, which is also consistent with Type Ibn SN PTF12ldy (Hosseinzadeh et al. 2016), around a month after the maximum light. ASASSN-18od, observed on 2018-07-06.42, is a type Ia SN a week before the maximum. The age has been estimated using SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) and the redshift is consistent with that of the host galaxy (z=0.018229)."

500,ATEL #11831,"Following the report of a hard to soft accretion state transition (ATel #11820) in the currently outbursting candidate black hole X-ray binary, MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11399, #11400, #11404, #11406, #11418, #11420, #11440), we performed target-of-opportunity observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Submillimeter Array (SMA). We last observed MAXI J1820+070 with both ALMA and the SMA on April 12. ALMA observations were taken on 2018 April 12 between 08:12-10:36 UTC and on 2018 July 6 between 01:31-06:18 UTC (MJD~58305.063-58305.262), in the 335.5-339.4 GHz and 347.5-351.5 GHz frequency bands. On April 12, the ALMA flux density at 343 GHz was very bright, ~120 mJy. Highly preliminary quality assurance checks on the July 6 observations detected MAXI J1820+070 with peak flux densities of 7.2 mJy (near 03 UT) and 4.9 (near 05 UT) mJy at a representative frequency of 343.5 GHz. We estimate that these preliminary measurements have absolute fluxes only good to ~25%, but that the drop in the flux density over two hours is likely real. SMA observations occurred on 2018 April 12 between 11:00-20:00 UT and on 2018 July 6 between 09:05 - 11:40 UTC (MJD=58305.378-58305.486). During our observations, the two SMA receivers were tuned to local oscillator frequencies of 223/231 GHz (April 12) and 223/275 GHz (July 6). On April 12, the SMA flux density was ~100 mJy at 227 GHz (where the flux was highly variable during the observation). Stacking the two frequency bands together in the image plane on July 6, we detect a 3 sigma source coincident with the position measured from our previous mm/sub-mm observations (ATel #11440). Fitting a point source in the image plane we measure a preliminary flux density of 2.6 +/-0.8 mJy at 249 GHz. We see clear evidence for reduced jet flux density values at mm/sub-mm frequencies between April 12 and July 6 observations. Over this same time, Swift/BAT only measured a moderate drop in hard X-rays (15-50 keV; 0.66+/-0.03 counts/cm^2/s on April 12 dropping to 0.21 +/-0.02 counts/cm^2/s on July 5/6 near 23:40 - 07:45 UTC). All measurements of the jets flux density on July 6 are significantly fainter than that predicted by the standard radio/X-ray correlation (f_r &prop; f_x^0.7) based on their April 12 values. This strongly suggests that the radio jet was quenching on July 6 as the hard intermediate - soft intermediate state transition occurred (ATel #11823). Radio through mm/sub-mm detections of black hole X-ray binaries typically arise from a compact synchrotron-emitting jet, characterized by a flat to slightly inverted, optically thick spectrum, that can break to a steep, optically thin spectrum at higher frequencies. The spectral break of the jet has been seen to move to lower frequencies as the compact jet is quenched during transitions to softer accretion states (e.g., Russell et al. 2014, MNRAS, 439, 1390). The ALMA and SMA flux densities on July 6 are increasingly more discrepant from those expected from the hard X-ray flux. Moreover, the measurement of the early ALMA flux density is nearly simultaneous with the recently reported ~6 mJy AMI detection towards the end of its monitoring on July 5/6 (ATel #11827). Our best explanations for these data requires that both the jet-power drop (relative to that expected from the accretion rate) and that either: (a) the radio--sub-mm spectrum has transformed from being inverted on April 12 to nearly flat on July 6 or (b) the spectral break moved from above 350 GHz on April 12 to below 350 GHz (possibly to frequencies below the SMA band) on July 6. We thank the SMA and ALMA staff for rapidly scheduling our observations."

502,ATEL #11833,"Hole, Transient We report on near-infrared and optical photometry of the bright X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070/ASASSN-18ey (ATel #11399, #11400, #11406, #11418, #11420, , #11421, #11423, #11439, #11451, #11462, #11481), carried out with the 60-cm robotic telescope REM (La Silla, Chile). The source was reported recently to be undergoing a fast spectral transition (#11820, #11823, #11827). REM has been monitoring the target almost daily since 2018 Mar 22nd, observing nearly simultaneously in optical (four simultaneous filters, g', r', i', z') and near-infrared (cycling over three filters, J, H, K). The latest three observations were carried out on 2018 July 2nd (from about 04:15 to 04:30 UT), 8th (03:33 - 03:46) and 9th (04:18 - 04:31), the gap being due to bad weather in La Silla. The source is always detected in each single filter. Magnitudes were calibrated against a number of standard stars in the field of view. Preliminary analysis shows that the optical flux is roughly constant, with the griz magnitudes being all around 13.3 +/- 0.13 during all observations. There is instead clear evidence for a declining near-infrared flux, especially at the reddest filter, with a K magnitude going from 11.82 +/- 0.18 on July 2nd to 12.38 +/- 0.12 on July 8th to 12.43 +/- 0.14 on July 9th. We assumed E(B-V)=0.163 (#11418) to deredden the observed magnitudes, obtaining an inverted (optically thick) optical spectrum going from about 30 mJy in g' to 20 mJy in z', with a spectral index of about 0.5. The spectrum extended with a similar spectral index to the NIR regime, reaching a flux of about 13 mJy in K, on July 2nd. On July 8th and 9th, while the optical spectrum was observed to remain constant, the NIR spectrum steepened, showing a z'-to-K spectral index of about 1 as the flux in the K filter reached a flux of about 7 mJy. We note that these values must be taken with caution given the large current uncertainties. Nevertheless, the rather smooth evolution of the magnitudes in most filters seems to confirm the overall trend, which appears consistent with a quenching of the compact jet during the state transition REM will continue to observe this target on a daily basis, weather allowing. In particular, a long observation is scheduled for the upcoming Chilean night, as REM is expected to stare at this source from 23:30 July 9th to 06:30 July 10th (UT). Multi-wavelength coverage is highly encouraged, especially but not only at high high time resolution and/or at longer wavelengths than near-infrared.

Echelle spectra were obtained 2018 Jul 7.85 UT (HJD 58307.4238) at Observatoire de la Tourbiere, France, RC400 Astrosib-Eshel-ATIK460EX2018 with a resolution of ~11000 covering 4250-7585, 10x1200 sec; the average S/N ~ 40 at 6000A. The Na I D lines show two absorption features, -1500 km/s and -820 km/s, with the higher velocity absorption stronger but approximately the same velocity width. There is still strong emission in the line extending to +2000 km/s. The Mg I triplet shows virtually the same profile as Na I but the overlap of the multiplet components changes the absorption widths; Na I 5686 may also be present. Fe II RMT 42 lines show two components of unequal absorption strength (4923, -1600 km/s, 3.1A; -800, 1.3A; 5018, 2.2A,1.4A; 5169, 2.5A, 1.5A:) with the velocity widths 600 km/s and 400 km/s, respectively. The emission wing is similarly extended to +200 km/s, and structure is beginning to appear (double peak) at low velocity (-350,+500 km/s). Si II 6347,6371 show almost identical absorption features as Fe II but neither line shows emission. Al II 6237 is possibly present, blended with Fe II 6248, with weaker absorption but with a similar velocity extent as Na I. The Balmer lines show the same structures as Fe II with a broader high velocity absorption component. The same two peaks at low velocity are present on Halpha and Hbeta, although less visible on Halpha; the emission peak ratio is about 3.6; the spectra were normalized and uncorrected for interstellar extinction. Although not displaying any emission component, He I 5876, 6678 show a broad detached absorption feature at -1500 km/s (full width at continuum ~ 500 km/s). This has been observed in several novae at this early stage, notably V339 Del. This feature is a broad absorption to the blue of the Na I narrower features. Neither [O I] nor [N II] are visible. The dominant emission lines are still from singly ionized metals, few if any forbidden lines are present (e.g. [Fe II] 5159 is absent) and the nova appears to be in a later stage of the Fe-curtain with the recombination Several DIBSs are visible in this last spectrum, notably 5780A (EW ~ 0.63A), 5797A (0.33A), 6613A (0.32A).

507,ATEL #11828,"MAXI/GSC observations of the microquasar GRS 1915+105 show that the X-ray flux is nearly exponentially decreasing in the last >100 days. Currently, the source is in the faintest state in the soft (< 10 keV) X-ray band in the last 22 years of continuous monitoring with RXTE/ASM and MAXI/GSC. The GSC spectrum obtained from 20:14 on 2018 July 7 (MJD 58306) to 13:17 July 8 is well described by an absorbed power-law model with a photon index of 2.67 +/- 0.40 and a hydrogen column density nH of (5.4 +/- 2.0)e22 atoms/cm2, or by an absorbed disk blackbody (diskbb) model with an inner disk temperature of 2.2 +/- 0.4 keV and nH of (1.7 +/- 1.4)e22 atoms/cm2. The absorbed 2-10 keV X-ray flux in the power-law fit is 2.4e-9 erg/s/cm2 (unabsorbed power-law model, 4.3e-9 erg/s/cm2). The hard X-ray flux observed with Swift/BAT is also declining, but it is not the historically faintest ( ). We note that the hard X-ray flux obtained with Swift/BAT and the 15-50 keV/ 2-10 keV ratios obtained with Swift/BAT and MAXI/GSC show an unusual negative correlation, and the ratio is the highest ever. The present source activity may be classified of class ""chi"" according to the classification of variability by Belloni et al. (2000, A&A 355, 271), or is in a soft state shown by Ueda et al. (2009, ApJ 695, 888). Continuous short-term variability study is required to confirm it. Peculiar properties of this source among black hole binaries are often attributed to its high mass accretion rate. The long-term exponential decay in X-ray flux just similar to other X-ray novae might suggest the end of the outburst of this long-lived X-ray nova. We note, however, that such declines were observed a few times previously and later the flux increased again. Thus, we encourage multi-wavelength observations to confirm the current status of the source and to understand the anomalous nature of the microquasar GRS 1915+105. MAXI/GSC data of GRS 1915+105:  "
508,ATEL #11827,"We report further (Atel #11420) observations of the black hole XRB candidate MAXI J1820+070 with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA). Observations were initiated after reports (ATels #11820, #11823) that the source was rapidly undergoing a state transition. Data were taken at a central frequency of 15.5 GHz, with J1824+1044 and 3C 286 used as the phase and absolute flux calibrator respectively. Date were reduced using the custom software pipeline REDUCE_DC (e.g. Davies et al. 2009, Perrott et al. 2015). We observed the source intermittently between 18:31:41.4 and 03:05:32.5 (UTC) on 05-Jul-2018/06-Jul-2018, 19:51:31.3 and 04:52:18.9 (UTC) on 06-Jul-2018/07-Jul-2018 and 19:29:38.9 and 04:48:22.9 on 07-Jul-2018/08-Jul-2018. As variability is expected in the radio emission during a state transition we calculate a channel and baseline averaged UV-amplitude coefficient directly from the UV data in 10 minute time intervals (note that there are no other sources in the field). The flux density on the night of 05-July-2018 showed a significant drop from our previous measurement on 02-Jul-2018, falling from ~40 mJy to ~10 mJy. The source then continued to decline over the course of this observation, ending at ~6 mJy. The following night (06-July-2018) we observe a radio flare, with the flux density at the start of the night at ~15 mJy, rising to ~40 mJy over a ~3.5 hour period, and then decaying back to ~15 mJy over ~4.5 hours, at which point the source was no longer observable. On the final night of our observations (07-July-2018) we measure a flux density of ~1.5 mJy and see no major variation over the course of the observation. These observations, showing significantly quenched radio emission and radio flaring, are consistent with the reports of a state transition by the NICER team. We plan on continued monitoring of this source and would like to thank the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory staff for carrying out these observations."
509,ATEL #11824,"On Jun 9 and 10 we carried out the third observing run targeting the black hole transient MAXI J1820+070 (ASASSN-18ey) with the fiber-fed fast optical photon counter IFI+IQUEYE, mounted at the 1.2 m Galileo telescope in Asiago (see ATel #11723 and other ATels referenced therein). Several observations were carried out between MJD 58278.041748 and 58278.079276 (Jun 9 01:00:07.0 UT through 01:54:09.4 UT) and between MJD 58278.881996 and 58279.083934 (Jun 9 21:10:04.5 UT through Jun 10 02:00:51.9 UT). We retained only the observations with better sky conditions, for a total useful on-source time of 4500s (4 observations taken on Jun 10). During these observations the average background-subtracted source rate was 2900 c/s. The sky background was regularly monitored with acquisitions performed between on-target observations and had an average rate of 1700 c/s. The fractional root-mean-square (rms) variability of the 1s binned light curve of the target was 4.2%. A nearby field star pointed in between on-target observations showed a significantly lower rms (2.6%). Power spectra of the non-background subtracted light curves with a time bin of 1 ms were computed for each night and were then averaged over intervals of 65s duration. We detected two broad QPO-like features on the top of a broad-band noise component (that were fitted with Lorentzians). The higher frequency QPO-like feature has a centroid frequency of 268 +/- 12 mHz, a full-width-half-maximum of 150 +/- 39 mHz, and a fractional root-mean-square variability of 1.9 +/- 0.2 %. The lower frequency QPO is less significant and has a centroid frequency of 151 +/- 6 mHz, a full-width-half-maximum of 33 +/- 16 mHz, and a fractional root-mean-square variability of 1.2 +/- 0.3 %. We obtained acceptable fits of the power spectrum also with two harmonically-related QPOs, that have width and significance similar to those reported above. Acceptable fits are obtained for 1:2, 2:3, or 3:5 centroid frequency ratios. A fit with harmomically-related QPOs performed on the April IFI+Iqueye observations (ATel #11723) gives similar results for the same harmonic ratios (1:2, 2:3 or 3:5). We note also that, within the errors, the QPO centroid frequencies of the June observations are two times higher than those of the April observations. However, the 268 mHz QPO has a significantly larger width than the 128 mHz QPO observed in April and its frequency is not consistent with the fractional increment of the centroid frequency reported in April."

511,ATEL #11823,"Following the onset of a rapid state transition in the black hole transient ASASSN-18ey/MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11820), NICER has been observing the source with a very high cadence (see left panel in figure linked at the end of this telegram). The new NICER observations show that in the past 24 hours, the 0.2-12 keV count rate (scaled to 52 active Focal Plane Modules) has increased from ~41000 cts/s around July 5 22:00 UTC to 66000 cts/s (>6 Crab in rate) around July 6 19:20 UTC. During this period the spectral hardness decreased smoothly. The (type C) low-frequency QPO that we reported in ATel #11820 increased in frequency from ~3.8 Hz on July 5 22:00 UTC to 6.4 Hz on July 6 11:45 UTC, while it significantly weakened. Around 14:45 UTC the QPO was only marginally detected around 8 Hz, although its harmonic at ~16 Hz could still be seen clearly. A rapid jump in count rate (from ~57000 cts/s to ~63000 cts/s) occurred during the time interval of July 06 16:05-16:16 UTC. This sudden increase in count rate was not accompanied by a strong change in hardness. However, after the count rate jump a type-B QPO appeared in the power spectrum, around 4.4 Hz. This type-B QPO was still present in our most recent observation (July 6 19:20 UTC), but had decreased in frequency to 3.4 Hz. The power-spectral and spectral evolution suggest that the source has now moved to the soft intermediate state. This is confirmed by quantifying the 5-10 keV power-spectral shape in terms of ratios between integrated power in different frequency bands (see right panel in linked figure and Heil et al. MNRAS, 448, 3339 (2015) for details), for comparison with black hole transients observed by RXTE. Based on past observations of transitions between the hard and soft intermediate states in black hole transients, we expect that significant evolution should be taking place in the radio through optical, as the result of changes in the jet emission, including the possible launching of ballistic jets (see Fender et al., MNRAS, 396,1370 (2009)).

The NICER observations began on 2018-07-03 23:30:29.184 UT (orbital phase = 0.423 according to the ephemeris of Bhargava et al. 2017, ApJ, 849, 141) and are continuing. NICER initially observed the source at a count rate of 345 XTI counts/s, declining to 270 XTI counts/s within 38 minutes. The NICER observations show phase-dependent variability of approximately a factor of 4 in count rate, from a maximum of 1069 counts/s to a minimum of 252 counts/s. The spectrum shows significant line emission, especially between 1 and 7 keV. The spectrum can be simply approximated by a combination of an absorbed power-law plus an absorbed thermal emission component. Sulfur line emission near 2.6 keV is particularly strong, and the spectrum also shows strong emission from the Fe K complex near 6.7 keV. The power-law component has a photon index of approximately 1.2 with a column density of about 8e22/cm^2. The thermal component has a temperature of 1-2 keV, with a somewhat lower column (about 4e22/cm^2). The initial NICER observation had a flux of 8.4e-9 ergs/cm^2/s in the 0.4-12 keV band. A power spectrum of a portion of the initial NICER observation indicates the appearance of a transient QPO near 140 Hz at a significance near the 4-sigma level. This QPO has not, however, been reliably detected again in subsequent observations. NICER is a 0.2-12 keV X-ray telescope operating on the International Space Station.

A reversal of this behavior was observed in mid-June. The NICER X-ray Timing Instrument (XTI) showed a broad minimum (at ~5600 cts/s) yielding to an increase in count rate, along with a softening of the spectrum. This increase and softening have both been accelerating in the past week. On July 5 the average 0.2-12 keV count rate was ~34300 cts/s, up from ~9300 cts/s on June 27. Rapid evolution has also been seen in the power density spectra. The low-frequency QPOs, which have been reported previously (ATel #11488, #11510 #11576, #11578), have increased in frequency from ~0.35 Hz on June 27 to ~3.0 Hz on July 5. To emphasize the rate of evolution, we note that the QPO frequency doubled in less than 18 hours between the July 4 and 5 observations. The spectrum of the July 5 observation is reasonably well described by an absorbed continuum model consisting of a disk component, a power law, and reflection. The slope of the power law (~2.4) is considerably steeper than during the hard state observations of the source (1.6-1.7, ATel #11576). The unabsorbed 0.3-10 keV flux on July 5 was 9.8e-8 erg/cm^2/s. For a distance of 3.2 kpc (Gandhi et al. 2018, arXiv:1804.11349) this corresponds to a luminosity of 1.2e38 erg/s. The above behavior suggests that MAXI J1820+070 is currently in a hard intermediate state and transitioning, at an unusually rapid rate, toward the soft state. Since the soft state may already be reached within a few days, NICER observations of the source are continuing at an intensive rate and we strongly encourage observations at all wavelengths in the coming days to follow this state transition in detail. NICER is a 0.2-12 keV X-ray telescope operating on the International Space Station. The NICER mission and portions of the NICER science team activities are funded by NASA.

516,ATEL #11813,"NuSTAR performed a follow-up ToO for the transient AT2018cow (ATel #11727) starting on 2018-07-02 14:01:09 UTC under Director's Discretionary Time (DDT, PI Margutti). During this observation we obtained roughly 30 ks of exposure time spanning from roughly 16.2 to 16.8 days post discovery. AT2018cow is still clearly detected in excess of background up to ~50 keV, although we see a drop in the total flux compared to the previous NuSTAR observation (ATEL #11775). The spectrum can be described by a single simple power-law fit across the 3-50 keV bandpass with a power-law index of 1.39 +/- 0.02 and a 3-79 keV flux of 3.2e-11 ergs / cm2 / sec. This is slightly softer than we observed during the first NuSTAR epoch. For comparison with our previous results, we find a 15-79 keV flux for the model describe above to be ~2.4e-11 ergs / cm2 / sec, or roughly 20% fainter than we previously measured. From our analysis of 3.6 ks of Swift XRT observations obtained during the second NuSTAR epoch we find that the spectrum can be well fit with a single power-law model with a power-law index of 1.42 +\- 0.07 (all errors are 1-sigma). We note that this is harder than the Swift XRT spectrum we reported during the observation obtained during the first seven days, which had a power-law index of 1.60 +/- 0.03. A joint Swift/NuSTAR fit shows that the spectrum can now be modeled by a single power-law component across the 0.3-50 keV band-pass. We no longer see any evidence requiring a second, prominent, hard power-law component at high energies, which was previously detected by NuSTAR and INTEGRAL (ATel #11775 and #11788). We thank the entire NuSTAR team for arranging these observations."

We have started monitoring Mkn 335 with Swift in May 2007 (Grupe et al. 2007, 2012) when it was caught in a very low X-ray flux state, and we have followed it ever since. In our most recent Swift observation on 2018-July-02, 10:00 (UT), we found it in the UVOT W2 filter at 14.15+/-0.04 mag which corresponds to an uncorrected flux of (2.25+/-0.09)e-14 W m^-2 (Galactic reddening E(B-V) = 0.035 in the direction of Mkn 335, resulting in 13.86 mag and 2.9e-14 W m^-2).

Although the emission line gas was dominated by lines of H I, C I, N I, O I, Ca II, and Na I, He I 1.083 was already present. He I was not detected in the high resolution, July 1 spectrum of Gard and Sollecchia. That change, plus, Nova Scuti's comparatively broad lines for a Fe II type nova (1800 km/sec for Paschen Beta and Brackett Gamma), suggest that the spectrum is evolving fairly rapidly. The relative strengths of the O I lines at 0.8446, 1.1287, and 1.3165 microns and the very red optical continuum indicate that the interstellar reddening is significantly greater than one magnitude in E(B-V)."

523,ATEL #11805,"Gamma Ray, VHE, Binary, Black Hole, Transient We continue the daily monitoring of the microquasars with the RATAN-600 radio telescope and we confirm the increase of activity of microquasar Cygnus X-3, detected with AGILE by Piano at al. (ATel #11804) at >100 MeV. From 1 to 2 July (MJD 58299.966 to 58300.964) the fluxes increased in 4-8 times at 4.7, 8.2 and 11.2 GHz. Thus it occurred just after (~1 day) the gamma-ray event detected by AGILE. The spectrum on 2 July is well fitted by the power law: S[mJy] = 130frequency^(+0.66)[GHz] from 2.3 to 30 GHz. Such high fluxes from Cygnus X-3 at the higher frequencies have been detected in the fist time from April 2017. This flaring event is associated with the almost total ""nulling"" of the Swift/BAT 15-50 keV flux. According to recent giant flares (ATel #9416, #9444, #9501, #10126) of Cygnus X-3 in 2016 and 2017 we can propose that the microquasar entered in a ultra-soft X-ray state (Koljonen et al., 2010) with coming quench of radio emission, and after which a giant flare (>5 Jy) can most probably occur. Thus the current flaring event could be a precursor of a next bright flare, similar to two flares detected in September 2016 and April 2017 (Trushkin et al., 2017, Koljonen et al., 2018).

CZTI is a coded aperture mask instrument that has considerable effective area for about 29% of the entire sky, but is also sensitive to brighter transients from the entire sky.

531,ATEL #11799,"We report the search results of AT2018cow (Smartt et al., ATel #11727) in the Insight-HXMT/HE data. At T0 (2018-06-16 10:35:02 UTC), the source location (RA=244.00090, Dec=22.26800) was covered by Insight-HXMT/HE without occultation by the Earth. Within T0 +/- 100s, no significant detections (SNR>5) are found in a search of the Insight-HXMT/HE raw light curves with time bins of 0.1s and 1s, respectively. Assuming a typical GRB Band spectral (alpha=-1.9, beta=-3.7, Epeak=70 keV), the 3-sigma upper limit for the source flux is 7.7e-8 ergs/cm^2/s (0.2-5 MeV, incident energy). All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy). Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside of the telescope. Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).

532,ATEL #11800,"We report a new flare of the source of maser radio emission in the H2O line at 22.235 GHz IRAS 16293-2422. The source is associated with a young stellar system at a distance of about 140 pc (S.A. Dzib et al. 2018, A&A 614, A20). Observations were carried out at the 22-meter radio telescope in Pushchino, Russia. The spectrum contains a strong single peak at VLSR=1.6-1.7 km/s. During June 2018 its flux density doubled. The history of its flux density variations in 2018 is: Feb 27 - 230 Jy; Mar 13 - 271 Jy; Apr 24 - 2405 Jy; May 31 - 4723 Jy; Jun 25 - 9043 Jy; Jun 27 - 8878 Jy. The PDF graphs of the line profile can be downloaded from the indicated link. The source strongly flared several times since 1999, when we began to monitor it.

533,ATEL #11801,"We report on Swift/XRT observations of the optical transient AT2018cow/ATLAS18qqn (ATel #11727). Observations of the target taken on 29 June 2018 showed an increase in the X-ray flux compared to previous observations (ATel #11761), reaching a maximum flux of 1.8 +/- 0.7 e-11 erg/s/cm2 when we fit an absorbed power law model using wilm abundances (Wilms et al. 2000) and vern cross-sections (Verner et al. 1996) to the X-ray spectrum in the 0.3-10 keV energy band. The photon index at that flux was 1.2 +/- 0.8 and nh = 1.1 +/- 49.2 e20 cm-2. The most recent Swift observations, performed on 30 June 2018 (17:17:14-17:39:53 UT), suggest that the object has faded to a minimum X-ray flux of 6.05 +/- 1.32 e -12 erg/s/cm2 with nh=6.9 +/- 11.6 e20 cm-2 and photon index=1.7 +/- 0.4.

Echelle spectra were obtained by Olivier Garde (Observatoire de la Tourbiere, France, RC400 Astrosib-Eshel-ATIK460EX2018)Jun Jun 30.861UT (R ~11000), covering 4250-7585, 10x1200 sec); the average S/N > 50 at 6000A. Low resolution grim spectra were obtained by Umberto Sollecchia (L'Aquila, Italy; Alpy600, R~ 500, 3769-7288A, 5x960 sec exposure time), centered at 2018 Jun 30.874UT. The overall appearance of the spectrum is of strong, overlapping absorption features with few prominent emission lines (aside from Halpha) and high interstellar extinction. However, there are some notable features that warrant reporting. P Cyg structure is present on Fe II 6456, 5169, 4923, 5018 (the usual), v_max = -800 km/s, nearly symmetric absorption and emission in higher multiplets. Hbeta shows deep absorption but no emission, Halpha displays very strong emission (em/abs ~1) with an unsaturated (ejecta-like) absorption extending to -1700 km/s (similarly for the red wing). No He I lines are present in the spectrum at this stage. The optical Mg I triplet (5167,72,83) shows displaced absorption at the same velocity as Na I D1,D2, about -700 km/s, with the Na I D lines well separated even in the displaced components. There appears to be weak associated emission at Na I; the ISM absorption is at about +20 km/s (several components seem to be present, the lines are not completely saturated). Mg II is absent. The Si II 6347,71 doublet shows weak P Cyg, v_max=-800 km/s on both components. There are many overlapping absorption transitions, the spectrum is typical of a classical nova in the optically thick (Fe-curtain) stage. Overall, the reality of the individual features is confirmed with the low resolution Alpy600 spectrum taken almost simultaneously.

The 15-50 keV data obtained by BAT onboard the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory indicated that the current outburst started from 2018-06-20 (MJD 58289). Assuming that the present outburst traces the same profile of the previous outbursts in 2009 (Atel #1956, #1972) and 2014 (Atel #6212, #6243, #6265), the maximum flux is expected to be around 2018-07-03 (MJD 58301).

542,ATEL #11793,"We report the search results of gamma-ray emission from AT2018cow in the Fermi GBM data. Using the position (RA, Dec) = (244.00090, 22.26800) from Smartt et al. (ATel #11727) we searched for impulsive events from the last non-detection on June 13th (ATeL #11738) until the end of June 16th. During this time period the sky position was observed by GBM 54% of the time. GBM was not observing the source at the times of the spatially consistent IceCube neutrinos (ATel #11785). During this time range there were 5 on-board triggers, 3 of which were due to GRBs and the blind untargeted search of GBM data identified 4 additional GRB candidates in the time range. None of these transients are consistent with the source position of AT2018cow. We also performed dedicated sub-threshold searches. Both a custom run of the blind untargeted search and the GBM targeted search (traditionally run around gravitational wave triggers) identified a number of transients that are either before the 13th or statistically insignificant. We list those that are spatially consistent (with large uncertainties) here for completeness. 1. The untargeted search identified a 64ms signal at 2018-06-12 06:40:53.5. This is about a day before the last optical non-detection. 2. The untargeted search identified a 0.7 s long signal at 2018-06-16 00:04:45.4 but this may be due to background fluctuations. 3. The targeted search identified a ~2s long soft signal at 2018-06-12 14:30:22.5, before the last optical non-detection. 4. The targeted search identified a ~8s long, soft signal at 2018-06-14 23:06:13.3. 5. The targeted search identified a ~2s long, soft signal at 2018-06-15 at 02:10:47.8. All events identified by the targeted search are close in time to Earth occultations of Sco X-1, and their sky localizations are also consistent with the position of Sco X-1. For this reason, and considering their weakeness compared to the GBM background, these events do not constitute strong evidence for activity related to AT2018cow. If there was an impulsive gamma-ray signal at event time it is either one of these candidate transients, or it occurred while GBM was not observing the position of AT2018cow. Otherwise, we set impulsive upper limits of ~few x 10^-7 erg/s/cm^2 in the 10-1000 keV energy range for the times we were observing the event. At a distance of 60 Mpc and assuming a soft spectrum represented by a Band function with (alpha, beta, Epeak) of (-1.9, -3.7, 70 keV) this corresponds to an upper limit of ~few x 10^49 erg/s in the 1 keV - 10 MeV energy range. We also searched for longer-term gamma-ray emission using the Earth Occultation Technique. There are a few spurious detections likely caused by confusion with Sco X-1, but nothing consistent with the flux expected from the spectrum measured by NuSTAR (ATel #11775) or the possible detection in Swift/BAT (ATel #11782). We will continue to perform searches of the GBM data for this transient.

In each observation, a variable X-ray source was detected coincident with a bright optical counterpart at (J2000.0) R.A. = 19h 09m 20.906s, decl. = +01d 12' 24.56"", &#960; = 1.414 &#177; 0.028 mas (Gaia DR2 position and parallax). Its maximum 0.3-10 keV count rate is ~0.15 s<sup>-1</sup>, with an average about half that. Several of these images are contaminated by scattered X-rays from Aql X-1. The Swift-BAT source was also identified with XMMSL2 J190921.2+011225 and suggested to be Galactic by Stephen et al. 2018, ATel #11341. ROSAT X-ray detections are 1RXS J190923.2+011154 and 1WGA J1909.3+0112; evidently these are all the same object. On 2018 March 4 we obtained a spectrum covering 3965-6875 &#197; using the Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph (OSMOS) on the 2.4-m Hiltner telescope of the MDM Observatory. Typical of a cataclysmic variable, bright emission lines of H, He I, He II, and the C III/N III Bowen blend are present, together with (more rarely seen) photospheric absorption features of an early K-type companion star. Using the 1.3-m McGraw-Hill telescope at MDM, we obtained V-band time-series photometry on eight nights between 2018 March 16 and June 15. Six of these runs were 3-5 hours long at 33 s cadence. Flickering with full amplitude of ~0.2 mag was seen, but no coherent period was detected. Among these nights the mean magnitude ranged from V = 14.1 to 15.0. We obtained 20 more spectra with modspec on the 1.3-m between 2018 May 9 and 13, another 20 with the 2.4-m and OSMOS on May 20 and 21, and five with modspec on the the 2.4-m on June 5 and 7. The emission-line strength varies dramatically. The emission equivalent width of H&alpha; falls mostly in the range 15 to 25 &#197;, but it was as high as 43 &#197; in the discovery spectrum on March 4, and as low as 2 &#197; for some of our June data. In the latter spectra no other emission lines are detected. The radial velocities of the absorption spectrum show a sinusoidal (almost certainly orbital) modulation at a period of 2.06(2) days with a semi-amplitude K = 107(4) km s<sup>-1</sup>. This period is unusually long for a cataclysmic binary and requires that the companion be somewhat evolved if it fills its Roche lobe. The Gaia DR2 distance is nominally 707 &#177; 14 pc, and the reddening maps of Green et al. (2018, MNRAS 478, 651) give E(B-V) = 0.40 at this distance. From our spectrophotometry we estimate V = 15.5 for the companion star, which implies an absolute magnitude near +5 for the companion alone, more luminous than a main-sequence star of its early K spectral type."
545,ATEL #11788,"INTEGRAL is performing a public target of opportunity observation of the transient AT2018cow (ATel #11727) since 2018-06-22 18:38 UTC. We report here on the first 307 ks of on-source time taken until 2018-06-27 04:58 UTC. The source is detected by IBIS/ISGRI at a signal to noise ratio of 7.2 in the 30-100 keV range. The IBIS/ISGRI spectrum can be described with a power law with photon index &Gamma;=1.7&plusmn;0.6 and 20-100 keV flux 6 &plusmn;2 &times; 10<sup>-11</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (uncertainties at 90% confidence level in the whole telegram). We note that the NuSTAR spectrum above 15 keV give a hard power law with photon index &Gamma;=0.5 (ATel #11775), which is not consistent with the INTEGRAL spectrum, as described above. Therefore, we determined an average broad-band high-energy spectrum by combining the data of AT2018cow as measured by Swift/XRT (22-25 June, see also ATel #11739), NuSTAR (23 June, ATel #11775), and INTEGRAL/IBIS/ISGRI (22-27 June). To account for source variability, we leave the intercalibration constant between the instruments as a free parameter. The broad-band spectrum can be well fit with a broken power law with exponential cutoff at high energy. The best-fit model parameters are the following: <table border=1 frame=void> <tr> <th> Parameter </th> <th> Value </th> </tr> <tr> <td> N<sub>H</sub> (cm<sup>-2</sup>) </td> <td> 2.0&plusmn;1.8 &times;10<sup>20</sup> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> E<sub>cut</sub> (keV) </td> <td> 39<sup>+29</sup><sub>-12</sub> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> &Gamma;<sub>1</sub> </td> <td> 1.41&plusmn;0.08</td> </tr> <tr> <td> E<sub>break</sub> (keV) </td> <td> 14.4&plusmn;0.7 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> &Gamma;<sub>2</sub> </td> <td> -0.3&plusmn;0.3 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Flux (0.3-15 keV) erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup> </td> <td> 1.08&plusmn;0.06 &times;10<sup>-11</sup> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Flux (15-100 keV) erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup> </td> <td> 5.9&plusmn;0.7 &times;10<sup>-11</sup> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> &chi;<sup>2</sup><sub>red.</sub>/d.o.f. </td> <td> 1.32/284 </td> </tr> </table> A plot of the unfolded spectrum with residuals can be found at <a href="" "" target=""_blank"">this link</a>. Residuals at 7-10 keV in the NuSTAR spectrum are present, but their discussion is beyond the scope of this communication. To estimate the significance of the high-energy cutoff, we jointly model only the NuSTAR and INTEGRAL spectra above the power-law break, i.e., we limited NuSTAR data above E> 15 keV. If we use a simple power law, we obtain &chi;<sup>2</sup>/d.o.f. = 86.9/64; if we add a cutoff, we obtain &chi;<sup>2</sup>/d.o.f. = 64.2/63. An F-test yields a significance of 4.3&sigma; for the presence of a spectral cutoff (i.e., the probability that the &chi;<sup>2</sup> improvement is due to chance is 1.3&times;10<sup>-5</sup>). More observations are planned and they might improve the significance of this detection.

546,ATEL #11789,"We obtained optical linear spectropolarimetry of AT2018cow/ATLAS18qqn (Smartt et al., ATel #11727) on four successive nights with the Bok 2.3 m telescope on Kitt Peak (+ SPOL CCD Imaging/Spectropolarimeter; range 400 - 755 nm, resolution 2.5 nm), as part of the Supernova Spectropolarimetry Project (SNSPOL;   ). We measure the following median values of the polarization (""p"") and polarization angle (""t"") across the 430 - 740 nm spectral range: Epoch UT Date p(%) t(deg) 1 2018-06-21.36 0.75 147 2 2018-06-22.35 1.04 124 3 2018-06-23.32 0.38 120 4 2018-06-24.33 0.33 121 From multiple observations obtained on the same night, we estimate a 1-sigma uncertainty in p of ~0.1%; the resulting uncertainty in t is approximately 5 degrees for the first two epochs and ~10 degrees for the final two epochs. The polarization at all epochs presents a smooth variation with wavelength to within statistical uncertainties (~0.5% per resolution element). The first two epochs are noteworthy for a marked increase in polarization redward of ~630 nm, with both epochs' polarization rising to values approaching ~2% at 755 nm, the long-wavelength limit of our observations. This rise is absent in the third and fourth epochs, which present a flat polarization level across the entire spectral range. It is possible that some (constant) component of the observed polarization at all epochs is due to linear dichroism (directional extinction) produced by interstellar dust grains along the line-of-sight in either the Milky Way or CGCG 137-068, the presumed host galaxy of AT2018cow. To test for Milky Way interstellar polarization, we observed the distant Galactic star BD+22 2949 (~5 arcmin from the line-of-sight to AT2018cow), and measure its polarization to be p = 0.37%, t = 115 degrees. The similarity of this value to our final observations of AT2018cow (i.e., ""Epochs 3 & 4"") raises the possibility that much of those epochs' observed polarization is indeed not intrinsic to the object, but is instead produced by interstellar Galactic dust. However, the temporal polarization (and, polarization angle) changes that are seen between individual epochs, as well as the unusual polarization behavior exhibited at red wavelengths during the first two epochs, imply an intrinsic polarization component to AT2018cow at least during the first two epochs. The standard interpretation of an intrinsic continuum polarization signal is that it stems from a departure from symmetry of the object's electron-scattering atmosphere in the plane of the sky (e.g., Hoflich 1991, A & A, 246, 481); however, this alone would produce a near-constant polarization level across the spectrum, in contrast to the wavelength-dependent signal we observe at our first 2 epochs. Other mechanisms, such as occultation by clumps in the outer ejecta or scattering by circumstellar dust (""light echoes,"" e.g., Nagao et al. 2018, arXiv:1805.11865) or other material in the vicinity, may be at play in the case of AT2018cow."
547,ATEL #11790,"We obtained 3 orbits of Hubble Space Telescope observations of the Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) SN2018bsz, the lowest-redshift SLSN-I at z=0.027 (ATels #11659, #11660, #11674; Hiramatsu et al. 2018), on 25 June 2018 UT. The observations consist of 2 orbits of spectroscopy with COS/FUV + G140L and 1 orbit with STIS/NUV-MAMA + G230L (PID: 15488; PI: Blanchard). The resulting UV spectrum covers a rest-frame wavelength range of ~1100 - 3100 angstroms and was obtained at a rest-frame phase of approximately 1 month after peak brightness. After correcting for Galactic extinction (E(B-V) = 0.207; Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011) and comparing the spectrum with the near-peak UV spectra of the SLSNe-I Gaia16apd (Yan et al. 2017), SN2017egm (Yan et al. 2018), and iPTF13ajg (Vreeswijk et al. 2014), we find that SN2018bsz is overall similar in spectral shape and shows most of the same strong UV features, namely broad absorptions centered near 2650, 2200, 1750, and 1425 angstroms. However, SN2018bsz does not show obvious distinct absorption features near 2450 and 1950 angstroms (the UV2 and UV4 features in the terminology of Quimby et al. 2018). The UV2 feature has been attributed to Si III or a blend of Si III + Ti III + C II (Quimby et al. 2011; Mazzali et al. 2016) and the UV4 feature has been attributed to Fe III (Howell et al. 2013; Mazzali et al. 2016). In the spectra of Gaia16apd and other SLSNe-I, the UV2 feature appears to weaken with time (Yan et al. 2017; Quimby et al. 2018), and so its absence in SN2018bsz may be attributable to the later phase of the observations. In addition, the features that are present in SN2018bsz appear to be somewhat broader than the other SLSNe-I with UV spectra, which may be causing increased line blending. The far-UV spectrum from COS shows a similar overall shape to Gaia16apd and SN2017egm, but line features appear relatively weak, which may again be due to increased line blending or the later phase of observations. Finally, we note that the spectral differences between SN2018bsz and the comparison objects may in part be related to having an unusual abundance pattern, as evidenced by the optical spectra (ATel #11674). We thank STScI for making these observations possible."

This target of opportunity observation was triggered by an enhanced flux level with respect to the secular flux average, as already reported using INTEGRAL data in ATeL #11754. The Swift/XRT observation was carried out in photon counting mode to determine the source position which resulted to be RA=65.00165, Dec=-54.93793 (04h 20m 00.4s, -54&deg; 56&prime; 16.6&prime;&prime;) with an uncertainty radius of 2.2&prime;&prime; (90% confidence level), using the enhanced UVOT field astrometry.

550,ATEL #11785,"IceCube has performed a search for track-like muon neutrino events arriving from the position of AT2018cow/ATLAS18qqn (Smartt et al., ATel #11727) in the time range of the last confirmed non-detection (Fremling et al. ATel #11738, 2018-06-13 00:00 UTC) to the detection time (ATel #11727, 2018-06-16 10:35 UTC). Two neutrino track events are found in spatial coincidence with AT2018cow during this ~3.5 day period and are consistent with the expected rate of atmospheric neutrino background (0.17 events expected in this time). A maximum likelihood analysis returns a p-value of 0.03 (1.8 sigma). Based on this, a time-integrated muon-neutrino flux normalization upper limit assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE) at the 90% CL of 6.1 x 10^-5 TeV cm^-2 is found for this observation period. The detected neutrinos, both consistent with the source location within the track uncertainties for these events (~2 degrees) arrived at: 2018-06-14 19:51:09 UTC (MJD 58283.827) 2018-06-15 10:25:50 UTC (MJD 58284.435) While these detected neutrinos do not represent a significant detection, their arrival times are of potential interest to the astronomical community.

551,ATEL #11776,"We have continued to monitor the evolution of the optical transient AT2018cow/ATLAS18qqn (Smartt et al., ATEL#11727). Low-resolution spectra have been taken each night, using both SPRAT on the Liverpool Telescope (wavelength coverage from 400-800 nm; resolution of 2 nm) and the SED Machine on the Palomar 60-inch telescope (wavelength coverage from 380-920 nm; resolution of 5 nm). We are also monitoring the transient in ugrizH filters nightly at LT. AT2018cow has faded every night since our first observations (ATEL#11732). The spectrum and broadband optical colors have become slowly redder. Beginning on 2018-06-19 UT a broad spectral feature (with a peak of around 550 nm, or alternatively a dip around 450 nm) emerges, as noted by several other groups (ATEL#11740, #11753, #11759, #11766). Although this feature broadly resembles the dominant spectral feature in optical spectra of Ic-BL SNe, its identity is not definitive. A possible spectral bump may be present close to 850 nm in all subsequent SEDM spectra, although this is outside the coverage of the LT spectrum and we have not confirmed its reality. This 450/550 nm feature is strongest on 2018-06-21 UT, about five days after the ATLAS discovery. However, from then on it appears to weaken. In our latest spectra, acquired with LT at 21:22 on 2018-06-24, it has almost disappeared. Photometrically, the SN has faded below the luminosity of SN1998bw at a comparable epoch in all visible bands, although it remains more luminous in the u-band. The u-band is not within our nightly spectroscopic coverage, but the u-g color excess suggests that there may be a separate feature in the u-band that is persisting. These observations suggest that although a link to Ic-BL SNe and GRBs remains credible given the smooth spectra and luminous radio and X-ray counterpart (ATEL#11737, #11749, #11773, #11774, #11775), AT2018cow is distinct in other ways and its true identity remains unclear.

559,ATEL #11775,"NuSTAR started observing the transient AT2018cow (ATel #11727) on June 23 17:31:09 UT under Director Discretionary Time (DDT, PI Margutti). From the analysis of 28 ks of data, we find the following preliminary results: AT2018cow is very well detected with signal in excess of the background up to 60 keV. NuSTAR data in the 3-60 keV range can be fit with a simple power-law spectral model with best fitting photon index Gamma=1.20 +\- 0.03 (1 sigma c.l.). This is significantly harder than inferred from Swift-XRT observations (Gamma~1.6; 0.3-10 keV) obtained around the same time. From our analysis of Swift-XRT observations of AT2018cow obtained so far (Swift ID 10724, segments 2-14), we find no evidence for statistically significant spectral evolution of the source. The combined 0.3-10 keV spectrum is well described by a simple power-law with Gamma=1.62 +\- 0.03 (1 sigma c.l.) and no evidence for intrinsic neutral hydrogen absorption in excess to the Galactic component along the line of sight (NH_gal=4.95E+20 cm-2; Kalberla et al., 2005). The temporal evolution of the 0.3-10 keV flux is consistent with a ~t^-1 decay, assuming t0 to be near the initial optical detection (ATel #11727). These results are in broad agreement with results from previous Swift-XRT analysis ( ATels #11739 and 11761). We do not confirm the soft photon index (Gamma~2.2; 0.5-10.0 keV) and intrinsic absorption NH~1d21 cm-2 inferred from NICER data (ATel #11773). Fitting the NuSTAR data with a broken power-law model we find a low-energy photon index Gamma1=1.53 +\- 0.03 (1 sigma c.l.), with break energy E~15 keV, consistent with the results from the Swift-XRT data at 0.3-10 keV. Above 15 keV NuSTAR data show evidence for an additional hard X-ray component with index Gamma2=0.50 +\- 0.05 (1 sigma c.l.). The inferred flux of the hard X-ray component between 15-79 keV is ~3e-11 ergs/cm^2/s. Further investigation is needed to constrain the physical origin of this hard X-ray component. We thank the entire NuSTAR team for arranging these observations."

After normalizing the spectrum against residuals found in direct fits to the Crab nebula (see Ludlam et al. 2018), and using a standard background region, the spectrum was grouped according to the ""optimal"" binning scheme of Kaastra & Bleeker (2016), and fits were made over the 0.5-10.0 keV band. A simple absorbed power-law model (ztbabs*zpow, assuming z=0.014) provides an acceptable fit to the time-averaged spectrum: N_H = 1.4(2) E+21 cm^-2, Gamma = 2.2(1), Norm = 2.5(2) E-3, chi^2 / dof = 94.5/93, Flux = 8.4 E-12 erg/cm^2/s (0.5-10.0 keV).

564,ATEL #11771,"In response to the <a href="" "">MAXI transient alert</a> regarding a new outburst of 4U 1630-47, NICER observed the black hole candidate for 1.96 ks in three exposures, with the first starting at 2018-06-11T13:37:26 (UTC). The source is clearly detected at approximately 230 cts/s (0.2-12 keV); no features (broadband noise or quasi-periodic oscillations) are present in the average power spectrum for this NICER observation. An analysis of MAXI/Swift data (ATel #11722) has indicated that this outburst is quite soft; no evidence of an initial hard state is immediately apparent (consistent with the discussion of occasionally missing hard states by Capitanio et al. 2015). 4U 1630-47 had reached a 0.5-10 keV flux of ~1e-8 erg/s/cm^2 (roughly 0.22 Crab) as of 15 June 2018. The 0.25-12 keV NICER continuum, background-subtracted using the method of Neilsen et al. (2018), is well described by an absorbed disk blackbody (tbnew*ezdiskbb; Wilms et al. 2000; Zimmerman et al. 2005). The interstellar absorption has a column density NH=(11.72+/-0.07)e22 with an enhanced Si abundance (A_Si=2.3+/-0.1), though calibration uncertainties near the Si edge make it difficult to interpret this result robustly. The disk has a maximum temperature of (1.084+/-0.006) keV, which is similar to the result reported from the Swift XRT several days later. Together with the variability properties, this suggests that the source is in the soft state. In addition to the absorbed disk, we find evidence of several narrow emission and absorption lines. The absorption features are consistent with Fe XXV and Fe XXVI absorption in an outflowing wind, as has been seen on many occasions in 4U 1630-47 and other, similar sources. These lines are detected at 6.74 [-0.03,+0.05] keV and 7.00 [-0.02,+0.01] keV with equivalent widths of 18 and 39 eV, respectively, and have 1-sigma widths below 0.023 keV (roughly 900 km/s). The apparent blueshift of the gas is approximately 1600-1700 km/s and is statistically non-zero at the ~3 sigma level. The precise numbers should be treated with caution in light of possible residual gain calibration uncertainty near 6-7 keV that can reach 20-30 eV, but previous observations of 4U 1630-47 with Suzaku and Chandra have revealed similarly strong absorption lines with blueshifts ranging from 200-1500 km/s (Kubota et al. 2007; Neilsen et al. 2014; Miller et al. 2015). The emission lines are observed at (2.36+/-0.03) keV and (6.36-0.03+0.04) keV, with ~4 sigma and ~3 sigma significance; we identify them as S K and Fe K, respectively, though we cannot rule out an association between the 2.36 keV line and the gold edge from the NICER optics at this time. The lines are nominally broader than the narrow absorption though still unresolved at (0.05+/-0.03) keV. Fe K lines are commonly found in X-ray binaries, but fluorescent lines from other elements are more rare. The S K detection here is facilitated by NICER's large soft X-ray area.

A spectrum of AT2018bto/PNV J00434212+4122349/Gaia18bkp (see <a href="" "">TNS</a> and ATel #11656) was taken on 2018 June 21.19 UT. The spectrum of AT2018cmi shows strong Balmer emission (H&alpha;, H&beta;, H&gamma;, H&delta;) on top of a blue continuum. The Balmer lines exhibit a 'boxy' profile with multiple peaks. The width of the H&alpha; and H&beta; lines are around 4800 km/s. We also note tentative detections of N II 5001, 5679 and 5938 &#8491;, and He I 5876 &#8491; emission lines. There is no strong evidence for the presence of any Fe II or O I lines. In conclusion, this spectrum confirms AT2018cmi is a classical nova in M31, the line profiles, line velocities, and lack of Fe II/O I lines suggests that this nova will belong to the He/N taxonomic class. This spectrum of AT2018bto also shows strong Balmer emission (H&alpha;, H&beta;, H&gamma;, H&delta;) on top of a blue continuum. The FWHM of these lines was measured to be about 2100 km/s. We tentatively detect emission lines from [O III] 4363, 4959, 5007 &#8491;, along with the Bowen blend at ~4640 &#8491;, with possible He II emission at 4686 &#8491;, and [O I] at 6300 &#8491;. Therefore, we conclude the AT2018bto is a classical nova eruption in M31 and that the spectral evolution may have proceeded to the nebular phase.

We also detect Galactic NaI doublet at the rest wavelength, along with H-alpha emission feature at the rest wavelength of the host galaxy (consistent with Perley ATel #11732). We do not detect strong H-beta, however (Selsing et al. ATel #11741). In addition, we see a Galactic DIB feature at 5797A, along with a tentative Galactic DIB at 6283A.

579,ATEL #11752,"We obtained photometry of AT2018cow (ATLAS18qqn; Smartt et al. ATel #11727) using the KPED camera on the Kitt Peak 84 inch telescope. Photometry began at June 20 04:19 UT on 2018-06-20. KPED is an EMCCD sensor, with the ability to run as a normal CCD, and photometry was run in both modes. The first was performed in the normal CCD mode, and we derive the following magnitudes (all in the AB system) using aperture photometry and field stars to set the zeropoint: U = 13.9+/- 0.3 mag g' = 14.4 +/- 0.2 mag, r' = 14.2 +/- 0.1 mag, I = 14.5 +/- 0.2 mag, Our photometry has not been corrected for host galaxy background contamination or Galactic extinction. The magnitudes are consistent with the blue, power-law reported by others (ATel #11732) and show fading of r=0.1 mags and g=0.7 mags compared to GROND measurements from 2018-06-19 (ATel #11734). A second set of photometry was obtained in g-band in the EMCCD mode at a cadence of 1 Hz. Observations began at June 20 04:58 UT on 2018-06-20 and lasted approximately 4.5 hrs. The g-band observations show a predominantly monotonically decreasing brightness, fading approximately 0.1 mag over 4.5 hrs, consistent with the fading reported by GROND (ATel #11734).

580,ATEL #11754,"During the observations of the Reticulum II region carried out from 2018 June 12 to 2018 June 19 (total exposure time of 208 ks), the IBIS/ISGRI instrument on board INTEGRAL detected significant hard X-ray emission from a source with coordinates: RA: 4:19:49 Dec: -54:56:28, with 3.5 arcmin 90% confinement radius and spatially coincident with the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1566. The source was detected in the IBIS/ISGRI mosaic images at a significance level of 9.4 (5.5) sigma and a flux of 5.9 &plusmn; 0.6 mCrab (6 &plusmn; 1 mCrab) in the 20-40 keV (40-80 keV) energy band. The source remains below the sensitivity level in any one of the individual 70 ks datasets if analysed separately. The source was not detected in the JEM-X mosaic images, from which we estimated a 5 sigma upper limit of 3 mCrab in the 3-10 keV band. Assuming a distance of 10 Mpc (Gouliermis et al. 2017 MNRAS 468, 509), the flux measured in June 2018 corresponds to a 20-80 keV X-ray luminosity of about 10<sup>42</sup> erg/s. Hard X-ray radiation from NGC 1566 was also detected by INTEGRAL in a previous observation carried out from 2018 December 26 to 2018 January 27 (total exposure time of 492 ks) at a lower flux: 2.6 &plusmn; 0.3 mCrab (2.5 &plusmn; 0.7 mCrab) in the 20-40 keV (40-80 keV) energy band. No INTEGRAL observations of that region were performed before. X-ray emission from NGC 1566 was reported on data from December 2004 to August 2013 in the <a href="" "">Swift BAT 105-month catalogue</a> at a lower flux level of ~2&times;10<sup>-11</sup> erg/cm<sup>2</sup>/s in the 15-200 keV energy band (0.8 mCrab or 15-200 keV luminosity: 2.3&times;10<sup>41</sup> erg/s). Swift/BAT detected a brightening from NGC 1566 with duration of about two months and a peak flux of 4 mCrab only once from 2004 to 2013. The enhanced hard X-ray emission from NGC 1566 detected by INTEGRAL might be caused by a high luminosity state of the AGN at the center of NGC 1566 or by an extremely bright hard X-ray outburst produced by another source belonging to the galaxy (for example, Liu & Bregmann 2005, ApJSS 157, 59 report the presence of three ULXs in NGC 1566) or spatially coincident with it. Additional INTEGRAL observations of the region around the source are already planned for the coming weeks. A target of opportunity observation with the Niel Gehrels Swift observatory has been approved. Further observations of the source in soft X-rays, as well as in other energy domains, are encouraged."

582,ATEL #11756,"We report time-series photometry of X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070 = ASASSN-18ey with the globally distributed small telescopes of the Center for Backyard Astrophysics (CBA; Patterson et al. 2013; MNRAS 434, 1902). Our photometry covers 88 of the 98 days since discovery on 11 March 2018. The average nightly time series was ~10 hours in duration, with various time resolutions ranging from 3 to 40 s. Most observations were in V light, with some unfiltered time series converted to V magnitudes by applying additive constants measured by simultaneous unfiltered and V magnitudes. During the first 80 days of outburst, no persistent periodic signal was found, to a limit of 0.04 mag amplitude. There was weak evidence for a transient periodic signal with P~8 hours during several ~5-day segments of dense coverage. Starting ~5 June 2018, the star began to brighten and show obvious (0.4 mag full amplitude) waves with a period of 0.703 days. The power spectrum and light curve are shown at <a href= > </a>. Clued in to this period, we could discern this wave another ~5 days before it became obvious. Over a 20-night baseline, the star obeyed the strict ephemeris Minimum light = HJD 2,458,281.595(10) + 0.703(3) E. We also saw ~10 s QPOs early in the outburst, as did many other optical and X-ray observers. The phase stability of the 0.703 d wave makes it a good candidate for the orbital period of the underlying compact binary, although other interpretations (superhump? precession?) are possible. Spectroscopic observation could test this hypothesis, and ascertain the dominant light source in the binary. Center for Backyard Astrophysics:  "

Spectra were obtained with the R1000B and R2500I grisms with an exposure time of 2x120s each in each grism, covering the wavelength range between 3700 and 10000 AA. The spectrum is dominated by a power-law continuum (probably due to the tail of the very hot black body mentioned in ATel #11742) with superposed undulations. By subtracting this continuum we find similarities with a broad-line type Ic supernova spectrum (see also ATel #11740), although a direct match is not obvious.

588,ATEL #11741,"We observed AT2018cow/ATLAS18qqn (Smartt et al. ATEL #11727) with VLT X-shooter on 20 June 2018, beginning at 02:18UT. A total of 600s of exposure time was obtained with spectra spanning the range 3000-25000A. The source is well detected across the wavelength range with very high signal to noise. We identify Ca H&K and Na ID absorption from the putative host galaxy CGCG 137-068. This confirms other spectroscopy (Jones et al. ATEL #11736) that AT2018cow is not Galactic and lies at (or beyond) z=0.0140. We also identify a range of narrow emission lines from OII (3727), Hbeta, OIII (4959,5007), H-alpha and NII that are likely from the host galaxy. The source is very blue, and can be adequately, but not perfectly, described by a power-law with beta=-3 (F_nu ~ nu^{-beta}) Alternatively a thermal model with a temperature of ~18,000K can be used. Neither scenario provides a good fit across the entire wavelength range. In particular, the presence of a very broad feature in the 5000-6000A range is noted in both cases, somewhat redder than reported by Xu et al. (ATEL #11740). There is also some evidence from deviation away from power-law of thermal models around 3750A. We thank the staff of Paranal for their excellent assistance with these observations."
589,ATEL #11742,"We report further observations and basic analysis of ATLAS18qqn/AT2018cow with ATLAS, ASASSN and the Liverpool Telescope. Two spectra were taken with the LT + SPRAT on 2016-06-18 and and 2016-06-19. Similar to Perley (ATel #11732) and Jones et al. (ATel #11736) we see a very blue, mostly featureless continuum. After correcting for foreground extinction (E(B-V)=0.08), the continuum is well matched to a thermal black-body of T=25000K. The latest ATLAS point (Smartt et al. ATel #11727) is cyan c=13.60+/- 0.02 on MJD=58287.45 (similar to Chen and Schady ATel #11734). Making it rather luminous at M_c = -20.5 if it is in CGCG 137-068. Correcting the spectrum to the dereddened c-band magnitude and assuming the object's SED follows a thermal black body, provides an estimate of total luminosity at this epoch of L = 4.1e44 erg/s, at a distance of 60 Mpc. At Teff=25,000 K, this implies a radius of 1.2e15cm (or 1.75e4 R_sol). There are recent non-detections by ATLAS (Smartt et al. ATel #11727) and ZTF (Fremling et al. ATel #11738) and ASASSN on MJD=58284. This implies a rise time (to c=13.6) of t_rise < 3.3 days. This is remarkably short for a supernova type transient to reach this luminosity. The rise time would imply an expansion velocity (to get to 1.2e15cm) of v = 42,000 km/s (or shock breakout from a very extended star). The detection of host galaxy absorption features of CGCG 137-068 (Jones et al. ATel #11736, Selsing et al. Atel #11741) at z=0.014, the Swift x-ray detection by Rivera Sandoval et al. ATel #11737, #11739), and the GROND rapid decline (Chen and Schady ATel #11734) suggest either a very high velocity (mildy relativistic) explosion (v>0.14c) or shock breakout from an extraordinary progenitor."

594,ATEL #11747,"Liller 1 is a Galactic globular cluster hosting the transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) known as the Rapid Burster (MXB 1730-335). Recent Swift and Chandra observations in late April 2018 identified a new transient X-ray binary in this cluster (CXOU J173324.6-332321, hereafter Liller 1 X-2, ATel #11598) and radio/X-ray follow up observations with VLA and Swift indicated that this new transient is likely a neutron star LMXB as well (ATel #11646). We have continued monitoring Liller 1 weekly with Swift/XRT. The outburst from X-2 peaked at an XRT count rate of ~1 ct/s (in the 0.3-10 keV band) on May 17th, 2018 (ObsID 31360148) and we observed the decay in the subsequent observations until June 11th, 2018. We estimate a Swift/XRT count rate of ~0.006 ct/s (0.3-10 keV) in observation on June 11th, 2018 (ObsID 31360155). This rate appears to be consistent with the expected Swift/XRT rate from Liller 1 when all of its sources are in quiescence. However, a short (200 s) Swift/XRT observation on June 18th, 2018 (ObsID 31360156) indicated a count rate of ~10 ct/s (0.3-10 keV) from the direction of Liller 1. Since this observation was in PC mode, pile up and the short exposure made it difficult to characterize the X-ray light curve and spectrum. We thus requested a longer follow up XRT observation that would be performed in WT mode. In this follow up observation on June 19th, 2018 (ObsID 31360157) we clearly detect two Type II X-ray bursts and thus identify the Rapid Burster as the source currently in outburst in Liller 1. Outside of the two type II bursts, we see a typical XRT count rate of 10 cts/s, dipping slightly before the bursts. The first burst starts 250 s into the observation, and increases within 3 seconds to ~200 ct/s. After 50 s, it declines quickly to ~80 ct/s, where it remains for ~25 s, then declines within ~5 s to slightly below the pre-burst level, recovering within 100 s. 600 s later, another burst starts in the same way, but the observation cuts off <20 s after the burst begins. We tentatively identify these bursts as mode 0 (using the scheme of Bagnoli et al. 2015, MNRAS, 449, 268). We thank the Swift team for approving and rapidly scheduling our observations."
595,ATEL #11740,"Transient We obtained 2x1200s spectroscopy of the bright transient AT2018cow (ATLAS18qqn; Smartt et al. ATel #11727) using the BFOSC camera on the Xinglong-2.16m telescope. Spectroscopy started at 13:25:11 UT on 2018-06-20, and the wavelength range covers 3600-9000 AA. Due to relatively low spectral resolution, we cannot confirm the presence of Ca II H&K absorption features at z=0 and at z=0.014 (likely the redshift of the transient's host galaxy CGCG 137-068), which has been claimed in Jones et al. (ATel #11736). As a whole, the Xinglong spectrum is blue and thermal-like. However, a prominent feature is evident in the blue end, more likely a bump centered on ~3960 AA than an absorption trough centered ~3790 AA, depending on the fitting of the spectral continuum. If understood as an absorption feature, it could be He I [3889]. A weak broad feature is also evident at ~5040 AA, implying very high velocity that can be seen inbroad-lined Type Ic supernovae. All the wavelengths are in the observer frame. Further spectroscopic observations are planned."
596,ATEL #11733,"V4332 Sgr is a luminous red nova exploded in 1994. We perform CCD BVRcIc photometry of its remnant since 2003, and medium resolution spectroscopy since 2005 using Russian 6 m telescope BTA, SAO 1 m Zeiss telescope and smaller telescopes of SAI Crimean Station. Between 2006 and 2008, the observations reveal the abrupt drop of flux by 4 times in the blue range, and reddening of stellar continuum, whereas emission line fluxes decreased by 30 times. Since 2012, the star brightness was grown up gradually. However, the rate of brightening accelerated since the last year.

The contemporary level of brightness has reached the 2002 level in the Rc filter, and has exceeded the 2002 level in Ic filter. Besides, color indices stay essentially red comparatively with the 2002 levels. The last spectrum has been taken with the BTA/SCORPIO on 2017 Jul 21.92 UT. It was flux calibrated using the magnitudes obtained from our photometry. The spectral range was 4048 -- 5842 &#197;, spectral resolution was 5.3 &#197;. The fluxes of the strongest emission lines of Ca I, Cr I, AlO look weaker only by 2-3 times comparatively with those in 2005, but Mg I 4571 &#197; and Sr I 4607 &#197; emission disappeared. Barsukova et al. (2017, ASPC, 510, 401) suggest that the 1994 event was the merger in a contact system with a 3-rd companion, an M-type giant, and the cool supergiant remnant of the merger was destroyed dynamically under influence of the 3-rd companion. The recent re-brightening was explained by authors as a result of the new approach of remnant debris moving on an elliptical orbit with the M-type star, and the accretion of them onto this star.

600,ATEL #11737,"We report on 0.5 ks Swift observations of the optical transient AT2018cow/ATLAS18qqn (ATel #11734, #11732, #11729, #11727). The observations were taken on 19 June 2018 using the XRT and UVOT instruments. Fitting an absorbed powerlaw model to the X-ray spectrum at z=0 we obtained nH= 6.8 +/- 0.08 e20 cm2, photon index = 1.48 +/- 0.2 and a flux of 3.4 +/- 0.5 e-11 ergs/cm2/s in the 0.3-10 keV band. We determine UVOT magnitudes in the following 6 filters (all in Vega system) v = 13.79 +/- 0.04 mags b = 13.82 +/- 0.02 mags u = 12.53 +/- 0.03 mags uvw1 = 11.75 +/- 0.02 mags uvw2 = 11.70 +/- 0.01 mags uvm2 = 11.60 +/- 0.02 mags If the object is a CV with typical M_V= 5, the object would be at a distance of around 600pc. This means that the X-ray luminosity would be Lx ~1.4e33 erg/sec, suggesting that the WD would be heavy, both to allow such high X-ray luminosity and to have the X-ray spectrum be so hard. However, the fast evolution of the outburst suggests it is a short orbital period system. If as suggested in Atel #11736, the source is associated with CGCG 137-068, Lx would be about 10^10 times higher, or Lx ~1.4e43 erg/sec. In this case, the mostly featureless spectrum and this X-ray luminosity combine to suggest a gamma-ray burst afterglow, perhaps from an off-axis GRB."

The spectrum shows that is a peculiar type Ia supernova at about a few days before the maximum light. Cross-correlation with a library of supernova spectra using the ""Supernova Identification"" code (SNID; Blondin and Tonry 2007, Ap.J. 666, 1024) shows that it matches with SN 2005hk at t = - 3 days.

The spectrum, taken at 2018-06-18.951 UT, is very blue and hot, approximately described by a power-law in flux with F_lambda ~ lambda^(-3.2). There are no strong emission or absorption features visible across the observed wavelength range (between 402-800 nm, wavelength resolution ~2 nm). In particular, we observe no features either at z=0 or at z=0.0141 (the redshift of the coincident galaxy CGCG 137-068), with the exception of weak H-alpha at the galaxy redshift which could originate from the galaxy background."
606,ATEL #11726,"ASASSN-18mr (TNS #19408) is a g=17.7 mag transient in the host galaxy 2MASX J23393156-0308565, at a distance of 96 Mpc (z=0.023763) discovered by the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, Holoien, et al. 2017, MNRAS, 464, 2672) on 2018-06-14. It is spatially coincident (within 0.4 arcsec) with a Pan-STARRS transient discovered in 2015. The Pan-STARRS Survey for Transients (PSST) reported PS15dkt at w = 20.72 +/- 0.05 on 2015-12-09 (MJD=57365.2). It is also detected in poor seeing images the night after (For PSST information, see   Huber et al. ATel #7153 and Chambers et al. 2016, arXiv:1612.05560) Summary details are as follows Name | RA (J2000) | Dec (J2000) | Disc.

A spectrum taken on 2018-06-17.192 (UT) using SPRAT on the Liverpool Telescope (range 400-810 nm, resol. 1.8 nm) shows the characteristic interaction driven hydrogen emission lines of a type IIn SN. The spectrum is dominated by relatively narrow H lines in emission, with a FWHM velocity of 2000 km/s. A weak Na ID feature (possibly blended with He I 5876) and a broad bump at 5200-5300 A, possibly due to a blend of Fe II lines, are also detected. The spectrum is somewhat similar to that of the type IIn SN 2009ip (e.g. Pastorello et al. 2013, ApJ, 767,1; Fraser et al. 2013, MNRAS, 433, 1312). Type IIn spectral features are in general interpreted as signature of interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material. As a faint transient was observed 2.5 years before the explosion of ASASSN-18mr at the same location, this was likely a preSN major outburst, similar to those observed before the explosion of several Type IIn SNe."
607,ATEL #11727,"ATLAS is a twin 0.5m telescope system on Haleakala and Mauna Loa. Each unit has a single camera covering 28.9 square degree field of view and is robotically surveying the sky every night. Two filters are used, cyan and orange (denoted c and o, all mags in AB system), more information is on  . While carrying out the primary mission for NEOs, we search for and publicly report stationary transients (see Tonry et al. ATel #8680, Tonry et al. 2018, PASP, 130, 4505). We report a bright new transient source, which is spatially coincident with the galaxy CGCG 137-068 (z=0.014145, 60 Mpc). We discovered ATLAS18qqn (AT2018cow) on MJD 58285.441 == 2018-06-16 10:35:02 UTC at o = 14.76 +/- 0.10. ATLAS18qqn is offset by 3.46 arsec south, 4.86 arcsec west of the core of CGCG 137-068. If it were in the galaxy it would be M_o = -19.2. It has a very fast rise time, with no detection on MJD=58281.5 to o~19.5. Most likely it is a foreground CV in chance alignment with the galaxy. There are a number of blue knots (possible foreground stars or host galaxy features) visible in the Pan-STARRS and SDSS images. The transient is close to but not coincident with any of these sources. There are no previous outbursts in ATLAS or any other survey that we are aware of. To rule this out being a very unusual transient in this galaxy CGCG 137-068, or (more likely) confirm it as a foreground CV, a spectrum is required.

608,ATEL #11723,"We observed the black hole transient MAXI J1820+070 (ASASSN-18ey, see ATels #11399, #11400, #11403, #11404, #11406, #11418, #11420, #11421, #11423, #11424, #11425, #11426, #11432, #11437, #11439, #11440, #11445, #11451, #11478, #11481, #11488, #11490, #11510, #11533, #11539, #11540, #11574, #11576, #11578, #11591, #11596, #11609) with the fiber-fed fast optical photon counter IFI+IQUEYE, mounted at the 1.2 m Galileo telescope in Asiago. The source was observed in white light on April 18-19 and May 21-22. On April 18 and 19, seven 900s observations were carried out between MJD 58226.991338 (Apr 18 23:47:31.6 UT) and MJD 58227.144271 (Apr 19 03:27:45.0 UT). On May 21 and 22, eight observations of different duration (between 300s and 900s each) were performed between MJD 58259.974418 (May 21 23:23:09.7 UT) and MJD 58260.173968 (May 22 01:46:30.8 UT). We retained only the observations with better sky conditions, for a total useful on-source time of 3600s (4 observations) in April 18-19 and 1200s (3 observations) in May 21-22. The fractional root-mean-square (rms) variability of the 1s binned light curve was 8.1% on April 18-19, when the background-subtracted average source rate was ~8700 counts/s (background rate ~2200 c/s). The sky background was regularly monitored with acquisitions performed between on-target observations. Also a nearby field star with comparable count rate was pointed in between on-target observations and showed a significantly lower rms (3.7%). On May 21-22, the source net rate and fractional rms were ~900 c/s and 5.1%. Power spectra of the non-background subtracted light curves with a time bin of 1 ms were computed for each night and were then averaged over intervals of 130s duration. In the observations taken on April 18-19 we detect a significant quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) on the top of three broad-band noise components. The QPO has a centroid frequency of 128 +/- 2 mHz, a full-width-half-maximum of 24 +/- 5 mHz, and a fractional root-mean-square variability of 3.1 +/- 0.3 %. Another QPO-like feature at lower frequency and with lower significance is present in the power spectrum with centroid frequency 71 +/- 4 mHz, full-width-half-maximum 36 +/- 16 mHz, and fractional root-mean-square variability 3.2 +/- 0.6 %. The 128 mHz QPO has a width consistent with that of the optical QPO reported in ATel #11591. The frequency difference between the two measurements, that are approximately 3.7 days apart, is 29 mHz. The fractional increment of the centroid frequency of the optical QPO is consistent with that calculated for a similar QPO detected in the X-rays with NuSTAR and reported in ATel #11578. The properties (frequency and width) of the 128 mHz optical QPO are also consistent with those of the QPO at ~0.12 Hz detected in the power spectrum of the quasi-simultaneous Swift observations of MAXI J1820+070 taken between Apr 16 and 20. In the observations taken on May 21-22 no significant QPO was detected. Despite the weather conditions were poor and the useful observing time short, we can constrain the fractional rms of a QPO with the centroid and width of the 128 mHz QPO to be smaller than ~2% (95% confidence)."
609,ATEL #11724,"In ATel #11708, we reported the detection of an unresolved source coincident with the position of the lensed star Icarus in a single epoch of ground-based g-band imaging of the MACS J1149 galaxy cluster on June 5, 2018 UT. Given the possibility of a bright and quickly evolving microlensing event, we obtained rapid follow-up imaging. In a detailed subsequent analysis using convolved archival 2011 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ACS WFC F475W images as a template, we find that an underlying arc and the lensed star with typical magnification of up to hundreds (as opposed to thousands as observed in May 2016) can account for the flux at Icarus' position in June 5, 2018 UT Large Binocular Telescope and follow-up Gemini June 14, 2018 UT optical images."
610,ATEL #11725,"As it was noted by some observers, the blazar [HB89] 0716+714 is undergoing new brightening phase since end of 2017 (see ATel #11107,#11339,#11676) after report of MAGIC collaboration about its strong activity in VHE (E>100 GeV) gamma rays. We performed a multicolor broad-band photometry of the selected blazars, using by the 1-meter reflector Zeiss-1000 of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of RAS (Northern Caucasus, Russia), equipped with UBVRI filters and CCD camera based on 2k x 2k EEV 42-40 chip. Our last measurements showed that blazar brightness became in some last days even higher than it was reported (ATel #11676).

611,ATEL #11722,"We report on a new X-ray outburst of the black hole transient 4U 1630-472 based on MAXI monitoring observations and a Swift ToO observation performed yesterday. 4U1630-472 is a recurrent black hole X-ray transient with repetitive outbursts (Kuulkers et al. 1997) and has turned into an outburst at least 20 times as reported in the literature (Capitanio et.al. 2015). It is very likely that it has been inactive for about 600 days since the end of the previous outburst in 2016 (e.g. Atel#9427, Atel#9462), although we can not rule out low level activities based on X-ray monitoring data of the crowded sky region. MAXI monitoring data indicates that from 2018 June 7 (MJD 58276) to June 15 (MJD 58284), the X-ray intensity of 4U 1630-472 in the 4-10 keV band increased from 67.85 +/- 4.8 mCrab to 186.2 +/- 9.92 mCrab, and the flux in 2-4 keV band increased from 60.06 to 144.74 +/- 9.81 mCrab, respectively. However, since the source is in a crowded region, it was uncertain whether the enhance X-ray flux came from 4U 1630-472. We requested a Swift ToO observation in the direction of 4U 1630-472, aiming at determining if 4U 1630-472 is in outburst. The Swift observation was performed on 2018 June15 from 07:48:02 to 07:52:51 and from 09:26:02 to 09:28:36 (UT). In the XRT observation performed in WT mode, we found a bright X-ray source located at RA 16:34:01.255, DEC -47:23:26.460, which is just about 9 arcseconds from the reported position of 4U 1630-472, thus the transient is likely 4U 1630-472. The X-ray energy spectrum is very soft, which can be fitted with an absorbed disk black body model with the best-fit BB temperature at the inner disk edge of about 1.0+-0.1 keV, indicating the source has already stayed in the soft spectral state. The net XRT X-ray count rate in the 0.5-10 keV band is 32.8 +/- 0.5 counts/s. From the XRT energy spectrum, we estimate its X-ray flux as (1.0+-0.11)x 10^-8 erg/s/cm^2 in the 0.5-10 keV energy range, corresponding to about 0.22 Crab. This is consistent with MAXI monitoring data. We would like to emphasize that since the beginning, the outburst has been very soft as seen with MAXI data. We would like to thank the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory PI Brad Cenko for scheduling the ToO observations and the MAXI team for providing monitoring data to the public."

618,ATEL #11718,MAXI J1727-203 is a new transient X-ray binary (ATels #11683) discovered by MAXI. Rau and Schweyer (ATel #11690) reported detection of a possible optical/NIR counterpart by GROND consistent with the X-ray position reported by NICER (ATel #11689). We observed the source with Swift/XRT in PC mode on 2018-06-13 from 04:30:15 to 04:49:27 UT. The source is extremely bright causing substantial pile up with an XRT count rate ~410 ct/s (estimated for grade 0 events; after correcting for pile-up). We model the source point spread function with an appropriate pile up model for Swift/XRT and enhance the astrometry by applying UVOT-derived offsets. Thus we obtain the following localization for this source: RA(J2000) = 17:28:29.8s (262.12429 deg) Dec(J2000) = -20:22:56.5 (-20.38236 deg) with a radial uncertainty of 1.8'' (at 90% confidence). This is 1.3'' away from the reported GROND counterpart. We also looked for evidence of dust scattering halos around the source. This is particularly difficult as the source is currently extremely bright and the point spread profile is too distorted by pile-up to establish whether a dust scattering halo is present. The source was also detected in UVOT in this observation with the following magnitudes (in AB magnitudes): B = 17.17(+/-0.06) U = 17.63(+/-0.06) UVW1 = 18.41(+/-0.07) UVW2 = 19.0(+/-0.1)

It was observed with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) using the Robert Stobie Spectrograph on 2018 June 10.92 UT (HJD 2458280.4297) employing the PG300 lines/mm grating. A 1200s exposure spectrum, covering 3400 - 9000 Angstroms at a resolution of ~18 Angstroms with a 1.5 arcsec slit, was obtained in clear conditions with 1.2 arcsec seeing. The spectrum shows a very blue continuum with broad but shallow H I Balmer absorption lines, with H-alpha showing an emission reversal in the core. We interpret the spectrum to be that of a Dwarf Nova in early decline from outburst, which is consistent with the ASAS-SN g-band light curve."

622,ATEL #11714,AT2018bym = ATLAS18ohj = MLS180520:184313+451228 = ZTF18aapgrxo was announced to the TNS by ATLAS (Tonry et al. 2011; ATel #8680) with a detection on 10 May 2018 UT and was detected even earlier by CRTS (Drake et al. 2009) on 5 May 2018 UT. We selected this event for spectroscopic follow up based on its ZTF data (Bellm & Kulkarni 2017; ATel #11266) as available through the ZTF Alert Archive ( ). An optical spectrum (covering 3800-9200 angstroms) obtained with Binospec on the MMT 6.5-m telescope on 9 June 2018 UT reveals that AT2018bym is a Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN) at z=0.274 (based on the presence of host galaxy [OIII] and H-alpha emission lines). At this redshift the spectrum is well matched to other Type I SLSNe near peak (e.g. PTF12dam; Nicholl et al. 2013). The absolute g-band magnitude in the latest ZTF data is about -21.9 AB mag. Additional follow-up observations are underway.

Spectroscopic observations with SALT revealed a blue continuum with emission lines at z=0.192 (ATel #11049), H-alpha, H-beta and HeI emission lines were composed of narrow (<350 km/s) and broad (FWHM ~= 2500 km/s) components. No X-ray counterpart of the optical transient was found during the two Swift observations on 2017-12-05 and 2017-12-29. A new Swift/XRT observation of Gaia17dbg was obtained on 2018-06-08 (after the solar conjunction gap) resulted in a non-detection. However, when the three Swift/XRT data sets are combined together, the resulting 4.8ks exposure image reveals a four-sigma (0.004 +/-0.001 cts/s) X-ray source at the position of the transient.

625,ATEL #11706,"The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of the two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, has observed renewed gamma-ray flaring activity from a source positionally consistent with the flat-spectrum radio quasar TXS 0646-176, also known as 3FGL J0648.8-1740 (Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23), with coordinates R.A. = 102.1187437 deg, Decl. = -17.7348444 deg (J2000; Petrov et al. 2006, AJ, 131, 1872), and redshift z=1.232 (Hewitt & Burbidge 1993, ApJS, 87, 451). Preliminary analysis indicates that this source went into a high-flux state starting on 6 June 2018, and brightened over the following days, reaching a peak daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (1.2+/-0.2) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty only) on 10 June 2018. The latter corresponds to a flux increase of a factor of about 60 relative to the average flux reported in the third Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL). This is the highest LAT daily flux ever observed for this source, exceeding that observed during a previous flaring episode in July 2015, reported in ATel #7833. The corresponding photon index is 2.3+\-0.1, and is consistent with the 3FGL value of 2.5+\-0.1. Because Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring of this source will continue. This source is being added to the ""LAT Monitored Sources"" and consequently, a preliminary estimation of the daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi-LAT will be publicly available ( ). We encourage further multifrequency observations of this source. For this source the Fermi-LAT contact person is S. Ciprini (stefano.ciprini@ssdc.asi.it). The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.

632,ATEL #11701,"MAXI J1727-203 is a new X-ray transient discovered on 5th June 2018 14:29 UT by MAXI (ATel #11683), with an optical counterpart detected by GROND (Atel #11690) and confirmed by the Hiltner telescope (ATel #11691), MASTER (ATel #11692) and Swift/UVOT (ATel #11697). The nature of the source remains unknown, though it has been suggested to be a Galactic black hole X-ray binary (ATel #11696). We report on optical observations by ULTRACAM on the ESO/NTT (<a href="" "">Dhillon et al. 2007, MNRAS, 378, 825</a>) over two nights: June 6th, 09:21 UT: Length of Observation: 3600 seconds Bands: u' g<span>'</span> r' Frame Rate: 1.5 Hz (u'), 15 Hz (g<span>'</span>, r') Signal/Noise: 5-7 (u', g<span>'</span>, r') June 7th, 08:01 UT: Length of Observation: 900 seconds Bands: u' g<span>'</span> i' Frame Rate: 1.5 Hz (u'), 5 Hz (g<span>'</span>, i') Signal/Noise: 7 (u'), 16-17 (u', g<span>'</span>) There was variable transparency, especially during during night 1, and the target counts were corrected with a simultaneously observed bright comparison star. The light curves show a lack of significant optical flaring intrinsic to the target, and no correlation between the faster r' and g<span>'</span> bands (See link at bottom of page). The fractional r.m.s (on a lightcurve using 1-second bins) was limited to <3-5% on the first night in r' and g<span>'</span>, and <2.5% on the second in i' and g<span>'</span>. We found no evidence of any optical periodicity. This lack of flaring differs from that seen in other black hole transient outburst rises, which typically occur in the hard state (e.g. ATel #10820, #11437). The optical fractional r.m.s during hard states is typically ~10% or higher on similar timescales in g<span>'</span> and r' (e.g. <a href="" "">Gandhi et al. 2010 MNRAS 407 2166</a>). Instead, MAXI J1727-203 currently shows a very soft X-ray spectrum and a significant disc component (ATel #11689, #11697), plausibly explaining the lack of fast optical variations. The ULTRACAM observations also occurred close in time to the hard-to-soft state transition reported by MAXI (ATel #11696). We note, however, that NICER also reports the presence of significant X-ray variability on timescales of seconds. The X-ray and optical light curves thus appear to be decoupled on these rapid timescales. We also checked Gaia Data Release 2 (GDR2; <a href="" "">Gaia Collaboration 2018 A&A in press, arXiv:1804.09365)</a> for a possible optical counterpart to this source. Within a search radius of 2 arcsec, there is a single GDR2 source with designation 4121064315074589696, G mag of 19.46 (+/-0.02 stat.), and no parallax measurement. This is located 1.9 arcsec to the south-west of the GROND position, and has counterparts in PANSTARRS as well as 2MASS; it is thus not associated with MAXI J1727-203. Follow up observations to confirm this lack of variability, and to further constrain the nature of this source, are highly encouraged. We gratefully acknowledge C. Clark, T. Cunningham and G. Voisin as the observers for this run and R. Breton for help with the observations schedule. ULTRACAM light curve example :  "
633,ATEL #11695,"ASASSN-18lp (AT 2018cex) was discovered by the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, Shappee et al. 2014) on UT 2018-06-05.24 at g ~ 16 mag. It was observed with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) using the Robert Stobie Spectrograph on UT 2018-06-05.75 UT (HJD 2458275.2561) employing the PG300 lines/mm grating. A 1200s exposure spectrum, covering 3400 - 9000 Angstroms at a resolution of ~18 Angstroms with a 1.5 arcsec slit, was obtained in clear conditions with 1.1 arcsec seeing. The spectrum shows a very blue continuum with broad but shallow H I Balmer absorption lines, with H-alpha completely filled in. We interpret the spectrum to be that of a Dwarf Nova in outburst."
634,ATEL #11696,"MAXI/GSC observations of the newly discovered X-ray nova MAXI J1727-203 (Yoneyama et al. ATel. #11683, also see ATel #11689, #11690, #11691, #11692) showed energy spectral softening starting from the middle of June 5 (MJD 58274). The 2-20 keV X-ray counts has been almost linearly increasing, but the hardness ratio (4-10 keV/2-4 keV) has changed from 0.80+/-0.20 at scans from 11:14 to 17:25 June 5 to 0.33 +/- 0.05 at scans from 07:18 to 19:40 on June 6. Thus, NICER (Ludlam et al. ATel. #11689) is likely to have observed the source at the beginning of the transition. The current GSC spectrum obviously consists of soft and hard components. If we fit the 2-20 keV spectrum obtained at 7:18-19:40 on June 6 with an absorbed power-law plus disk-blackbody (diskbb) model with n_H fixed at 4.6e21 cm^-2 (ATel #11689), we obtained the inner disk temperature of 0.39+/-0.11 keV (the power-law index, Gamma, is fixed at 2.0), or 0.32+/-0.14 keV (Gamma is fixed at 2.5). Here, due to the poor statistics, we fixed the power-law index. The diskbb component is dominant below 3 keV in the former case (Gamma=2.0), and in both cases the diskbb normalization parameters indicate relatively large disk inner radii, about 200 and 300 [(d/10 kpc)/sqrt(cos(theta))] km, where d is the distance to the source and theta is the disk inclination, for Gamma = 2.0 and 2.5, respectively. We also obtained the 90% lower limits of the radius, 32 and 29 [(d/10 kpc)/sqrt(cosA)] km for Gamma = 2.0 and 2.5, respectively. An absorbed blackbody plus power-law model also yields a similar large spherical radius. An unabsorbed 2-10 keV flux was 2.2e-9 erg/s/cm2 for Gamma=2.0, corresponding to the 2-10 keV luminosity of 1.9e37 erg/s for the 8 kpc distance source. The ultrasoft component with the rather low disk temperature and the large inner disk radius (for d > 3 kpc and the face-on disk (theta = 0 deg)) in the soft-state spectrum (e.g., Tanaka & Shibazaki 1996, ARAA, 34, 607) strongly suggests that MAXI J1727-203 is a binary hosting a black hole. Further multi-wavelength observations are encouraged. MAXI data of MAXI J1727-203:  "
635,ATEL #11697,"Starting on 06:55UT on June 7th, 2018, Swift began at target of opportunity of the likely black-hole candidate, MAXI J1727-203 (ATEL #11683, #11689, #11690, #11691, #11692, #11696). In 970s of Windowed Timing mode data, we detect a bright point source at a location consistent with the optical counterpart reported by GROND (ATEL #11690), confirming that that source is indeed MAXI J1723-203. The Swift spectrum can be well fit by an absorbed power-law model plus a disk blackbody. The fitted parameters are N<sub>H</sub> = 0.44 +/- 0.03 x 10<sup>23</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>, photon index = 2.5 +/- 0.2 and kT<sub>in</sub> = 0.46 +/- 0.01. We note that these spectral parameters are similar to those reported from a NICER observation on June 5th, 2018, although with a hotter disk temperature. Unfortunately the source lies partially outside of the WT field of view, making accurate estimation of the flux problematic, however, assuming the optical position and correcting for the missing part of the PSF, we find an X-ray flux of 3.9 x 10<sup>-9</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (0.5 - 10 keV, uncorrected for absorption). Timing analysis of the XRT data shows no obvious signs of QPOs or periodicities. The optical counterpart of MAXI J1727-203 is detected by UVOT, in all three filters in which it was observed, at v = 16.64 +/- 0.06, b = 17.05 +/- 0.05 and u = 17.42 +/- 0.05 (AB system).

Based on ground based photometry, the re-brightening previous to the current superoutburst was reported on 2018-June-1 ( ). We observed the object on 2018-June-7 for ~1ks with Swift using UVOT and XRT. The object was found to have a UVM2 magnitude of 11.63 +/- 0.02 in the Vega-photometric system (uncorrected for Galactic extinction). We determined an X-ray count rate of (2.1+/-0.5)E-02 cts/s in the 0.3-10keV energy band. SDSS J141118.31+481257.6 has become ~4.3 mags brighter in UVM2 compared to the last Swift observation performed on May-26, when the object had a magnitude of 16.00 +/- 0.10 in that filter (ATEL #11672).

638,ATEL #11689,"Following the MAXI/GSC nova alert of a possible new transient (ATel #11683), NICER attempted to observe the source at 2018-06-05T15:40 (UTC), within 75 minutes of the alert. Starting at the nominal coordinates reported by MAXI (with ~20 arcmin error radius), NICER performed a series of offset pointings, resulting in a preliminary improved source position of R.A. = 262.112 deg Dec = -20.385 deg (J2000), with 1.5 arcmin radius uncertainty set by the NICER field of view. There are no previously known X-ray sources in this region, confirming that MAXI J1727-203 is indeed a new transient. The source is clearly detected at a count rate of ~1500 ct/s (0.35-10 keV) at this improved position, well above the typical background level of < 2 ct/s in this band. The light-curve shows significant variability on timescales of seconds, the detailed analysis of which is ongoing. For the two offset-pointed observations (where MAXI J1727-203 was detected), only a portion of the data was available in real-time telemetry; the remainder is scheduled for later download. Initial spectra were extracted from these real-time datasets. The first observation, with a real-time exposure of 475 s, was collected at a ~2.5 arcmin offset relative to the source position reported above. The continuum spectrum (0.5-10 keV), after applying the Crab correction of Ludlam et al. (2018, ApJL, 858, L5), could be approximated with an absorbed power-law plus disk-blackbody model (chisq = 1098.2 for 944 d.o.f.). The absorption column density was measured at n_H = 4.6(1)E21 cm^-2, the power-law photon index at Gamma = 2.47(4), and the disk temperature kT = 0.20(1) keV. The second observation, approximately 90 minutes later, used the improved position and provided a real-time exposure of 340 s. The Crab-corrected spectrum for this observation can be described using the same continuum model (chisq = 1346.5 for 944 d.o.f.), with similar results: n_H = 4.6(1)E21 cm^-2, Gamma = 2.51(4), and kT = 0.24(1) keV. The photon index suggests steepening but is consistent with the earlier observation within uncertainties; the change in the spectral shape between observations may be due in part to the difference between the on-axis and off-axis response of the instrument. The absorbed 0.5-10 keV flux was 2.60(1)E-9 erg cm^-2 s^-1. We did not detect a prominent Fe line feature in either spectrum. Further NICER observations of this source are underway. Additional multi-wavelength observations are strongly encouraged. NICER is a 0.2-12 keV X-ray telescope operating on the International Space Station.

645,ATEL #11682,"We report an undergoing soft-to-hard state transition of the black hole candidate MAXI J1535-571 in outburst (ATel #10699). After the unexpectedly rapid decrease in the X-ray flux remaining in the soft state from 2018 April 16 (ATel #11568), the source underwent a hard state transition around April 30 (ATel #11611). Interestingly, X-ray re-brightening by a factor of about 400 was recognized on May 16, and the source has been in the soft state again since May 18 (ATel #11652). MAXI/GSC also monitored the source in the soft state from May 19, and recent GSC observations showed that a soft-to-hard state transition started to occur around May 26 (MJD 58264). The average 2-4 keV and 4-10 keV X-ray fluxes on June 2-4 were (4.2+/-0.6)e-2 photons/s/cm2 (~25 mCrab) and (2.7+/-0.5)e-2 photons/s/cm2 (~23 mCrab), respectively. The hardness ratio in the 4-10 keV to 2-4 keV band was ~ 0.64. This ratio is a similar one obtained on October 17-26 (MJD 58043-58052), suggesting that the source is still in an intermediate state.

We obtained a 600 s spectrum of this object under the SALT Large Science Program on transients on 2018 June 04.76 (HJD 2458274.25), using the High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS; Crause et al. 2014, Proc.

The data were reduced with the SALT HRS MIDAS pipeline (Kniazev et al. 2016, MNRAS 459, 3068). The spectrum is dominated by emission lines of H I, Fe II, O I, Na I, Ca II, and Si II (see below a full list of the line identification). The lines are characterized by P Cygni profiles with an absorption component at -475 &plusmn; 10 km/s, characteristic of optically-thick ejecta.

650,ATEL #11688,"As a supplement to the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; ATel #11266) public alerts (ATel #11685) we plan to report (following ATel #11615) bright probable supernovae identified in the raw alert stream from the ZTF Northern Sky Survey (""Celestial Cinematography""; see Bellm & Kulkarni, 2017, Nature Astronomy 1, 71) to the Transient Name Server ( ) on a daily basis; the ZTF Bright Transient Survey (BTS; see Kulkarni et al., 2018; arXiv:1710.04223). The filtering criteria for BTS transients are the following: (1) Transient candidate brightness < 19 mag (in the most recent g or r band measurement). (2) Transient candidate > 20 arcsec from bright stars (r < 15 mag). (3) Transient candidate has a minimum of two detections separated by > 30 minutes. (4) No star-like source spatially coincident with the transient candidate (we employ a machine-learning star-galaxy separator, based on PS1 data; cf. Miller et al. 2017, AJ, 153, 73). (5) Galactic latitude cut of 7 degrees. There is also a final human vetting step to filter out clearly bogus alerts and stellar alerts that our star-galaxy separator does not catch automatically. Furthermore, using these filtered alerts, we will carry out an ambitious spectroscopic survey; we will attempt to classify all transients brighter than 18.5 mag using the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM; range 350-950nm, spectral resolution R~100) mounted on the Palomar 60-inch (P60) telescope (Blagorodnova et. al. 2018, PASP, 130, 5003). For ambiguous cases we will obtain confirmation spectra using other facilities. These classifications will be periodically announced in future ATels, and on TNS. Here we report classifications obtained since 2018-06-02.

Assuming that the source flux was constant over three scan transits from 9:41 to 12:46, we obtain the source position at (R.A., Dec) = (261.971 deg, -20.389 deg) = (17 27 53, -20 23 20) (J2000) with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short radii of 0.33 deg and 0.28 deg, respectively. The roll angle of the long axis from the north direction is 154.0 deg counterclockwise. There is an additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment radius). The X-ray flux averaged over the scans was 37 +- 8 mCrab (4.0-10.0keV, 1 sigma error). Since the source is in the direction of the Galactic bulge, (l, b) = (5.2, 8.1), there are several 1RXS X-ray sources in the error region, e.g., 1RXS J172854.8-202151 (0.24 deg apart), and 1RXS J172903.6-202208 (0.27 deg apart). We, however, tentatively name this new transient source MAXI J1727-203 because no X-ray nova activity was reported from the 1RXS sources.

652,ATEL #11680,"AGN, Black Hole, Blazar, Quasar H.E.S.S. observations at very-high energies (E>100 GeV) of the flat spectrum radio quasar 3C 279 (reshift z=0.536, R.A.: 12h56m11.1665s, Dec: -05d47m21.523s (J2000)) have been carried out over the last 3 nights on the basis of another strong flare in the high-energy gamma-ray band (E>100 MeV) detected with Fermi-LAT. A preliminary online analysis of the data acquired with CT5 (monoscopic analysis; telescope diameter 28m) indicate for the night June 2-3 a significance of 5.7sigma (in 2hrs of observations), which has risen to 7.2 sigma in 3hrs of observations in the night June 3-4. The rate of events appears constant in both nights. H.E.S.S. will continue observations of 3C 279 over the next nights, and multiwavelength follow-up observations are strongly encouraged. Optical observations with ATOM show an increase of apparent R-band magnitude from 14.4 for the night May 28-29 to 13.5 for the night June 1-2. In the following two nights, the optical flux has been detected at this elevated level with variability within 0.3 magnitudes. Observations of 3C 279 will be continued. This is the third time that 3C 279 has been detected at very-high energies this year, with a detection by H.E.S.S. in January (ATel #11239) and by MAGIC in April (ATel #11545). During this time, 3C 279 also showed strong optical variability (e.g. ATel #11624). H.E.S.S. is an array of five imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes for the detection of VHE gamma-ray sources. H.E.S.S. is located in the Khomas Highland in Namibia. It was constructed and is operated by researchers from Armenia, Australia, Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Poland, South Africa, Sweden, UK, and the host country, Namibia.

655,ATEL #11677,"On 23 April 2018 INTEGRAL started an out-of-TAC public observation of nova ASASSN-18fv (ATel #11454, #11456, #11460, #11468, #11506, #11508, #11546, #11553, #11608). The source continued to be very bright in the optical band (V~6.8 mag) one month after discovery (20 March 2018), and it was, therefore, observed with the optical monitoring camera (OMC) in Fast monitoring mode. We report here one of the few observations using this observing mode. With this mode, 3 second-long integrations are performed at intervals of 4.5 seconds, and only the sections of the CCD containing the target of interest are read out from the CCD. On 18 May 2018, the OMC was configured back to Normal monitoring mode when the source brightness decayed to V~8.5 mag. INTEGRAL observations are currently still ongoing. We report here on the INTEGRAL/OMC optical photometric data accumulated from 23 April 2018 (revolution 1945) to 23 May 2018 (revolution 1956). The OMC photometric data are affected by time gaps produced when the source falls outside its field-of-view, because observing is in a 5x5 dithering pattern by the spacecraft. The light curve shows a general decline from V=6.76 on 23 April 23:10 (UTC) to V=8.06 on 13 May 05:30 (UTC). The next set of photometric data started on 13 May 20:50 (UTC) with a magnitude of V=8.35. Thus, the source brightness dropped ~0.3 magnitudes in 15 hours. After the drop, the light curve continues the general decline trend with the same slope as before the drop. In addition to this general decline at long time-scales, short time-scale variability superposed on the general decline is clearly revealed in the OMC optical light curve, thanks to the excellent time resolution of the Fast monitoring mode and the photometric accuracy of about 0.02 mag (systematic effects not included). In some occasions, the amplitude of the variability reaches 0.3 mag on time-scales of several hours to one day. Oscillations in the optical photometry of this source were also reported in ATel #11508, around maximum light on time-scales of days. According to the classification by <a href="" "">Strope et al. (2010)</a>, ASASSN-18fv can be tentatively classified as a J-class nova. Light curves of this class are characterized by substantial jittering above the base level. The variations observed in the light curve could also resemble oscillations like those seen in the O-class. However, a structure-function analysis of the OMC light curve indicates that the variability is essentially random and, as reported in ATel #11508, starts before the peak, while O-class novae are characterized by quasi-periodic oscillations which generally start around 3 mag below the peak. Future observations should help in the definitive classification of ASASSN-18fv. Due to the long INTEGRAL ToO program on ASASSN-18fv, the OMC is collecting a legacy set of well calibrated optical data on the source. The INTEGRAL/OMC optical light curve and additional information can be found at <a href="" ""> INTEGRAL Picture of the Month (June 2018)</a>. INTEGRAL will continue monitoring the source over the upcoming revolutions, so new OMC optical photometric observations will be available in the near future. We thank the INTEGRAL Science and Mission Operations Centres for their effort in making these observations possible."
656,ATEL #11678,"We report the discovery of DLT18y/AT 2018cdc, which was first imaged by the PROMPT5 0.41m telescope at CTIO on 2018 June 01.42 (UT) at r~16.9 mag during the ongoing D<40 Mpc (DLT40) sub-day cadence supernova search. A confirmation image was obtained on 2018 June 01.83 (UT) with the PROMPT telescope at Meckering Observatory, with an r~17.05 mag. DLT18y is located at RA: 00:51:05.24 DEC: -07:03:47.0 (~0.9 arcmin from the potential host galaxy NGC274). We do not detect the transient on 2018 Jan 06.35 (UT) or in prior imaging of the field. Since there is such a large gap between observations, and that the magnitude declines in our two detections, there is a chance that this is an older SN. All images were taken in a 'Clear' (PROMPT5) or 'Open' (PROMPT-MO) filter which was calibrated to an approximate r-band magnitude. Further observations are encouraged."
657,ATEL #11674,"ePESSTO, the extended Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey for Transient Objects (see Smartt et al. 2015, A&A, 579, 40  ), reports a reclassification of SN2018bsz (RA=16:09:39.19, DEC=-32:03:45.2). SN2018bsz was discovered (ATEL#11660) by the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae ASAS-SN (see Shappee et al. 2014, ApJ, 788, 48 and  ) and also recovered by the ATLAS survey, see Tonry et al. (2011, PASP, 123, 58) and Tonry et al. (ATel #8680). Initial spectral classifications of SN2018bsz were reported by both Hiramatsu et al. (TNS Classification Report: 2018TNSCR.679....1H) and ePESSTO (ATEL#11659) (both spectra can be found on wiserep:  ). Both classified the transient as a young type II supernova (SNII) due to the presence of a strong P-Cygni profile consistent in wavelength with H-alpha. However, later inspection of the spectra have revealed features that cast doubt on a SNII classification: no other Balmer lines are observed; a broad emission feature is seen redwards of H-alpha; there are a number of P-Cygni profiles observed between 4000 and 5000 Angstroms that are not usually observed in spectra of young SNeII. We tentatively identify CII lines (4745, 5890, 6580 and 7234 Angstroms) with blue-shifted absorption troughs at around 13,000 kms-1. Such lines have been predicted previously by spectral models of Super-Luminous SNe (SLSNe, see Dessart et al. 2012, MNRAS, 426 26), but are rarely detected at such strength. A number of spectral features are observed between 4000 and 5000 Angstroms, however the emission peaks appear offset in wavelength from the lines usually identified as OII in SLSNe. By comparing with spectra of other SLSNe I (using SNID: Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024), we obtain good matches with several objects including PTF12dam at -15 days and PTF09atu at -20 days. Inspecting the ATLAS photometry reveal a current o-band magnitude of 15.4 that translates to an absolute magnitude of almost -20 at the distance of the host galaxy. The ATLAS photometry also suggests that the transient is still rising (last photometry obtained four days ago). SN2018bsz was first detected by ATLAS at an o-band magnitude of 18.2+/-0.2 on MJD 58219, and there is a non-detection on MJD 58207 that constrains the explosion to have occurred around 50 days ago. We conclude that SN2018bsz is a type I SLSN with strong CII spectral features. Given a host galaxy redshift of 0.0267, this makes SN2018bsz the lowest-redshift SLSN to date. Given this reclassification, we may expect SN2018bsz to rise to be as bright as 14th apparent magnitude. Further multi-wavelength observations are strongly encouraged."
658,ATEL #11675,"On 2018-05-28-04:24:00.9 UTC (2018-05-28.18334375), UTMOST found a new FRB as part of the ongoing search program at the Molonglo Radio Telescope (see <a href="" ""> Bailes et al. 2017</a>). This is the sixth Molonglo FRB overall (See ATel#<a href="" "">10867</a>, ATel #<a href="" "">10697</a> and Caleb et al. 2017, MNRAS, 468, 3746). The FRB was discovered in real time, and voltage capture was successfully triggered (see<a href="" ""> Farah et al. 2018</a>). The dispersion measure (DM) of the FRB is: 899 pc cm^-3, which is substantially in excess of the Galactic DM as estimated by the <a href="" ""> NE2001</a> model (~69 pc cm^-3). The upper limit on the DM-inferred redshift is thus ~0.7. The S/N in the detection beam is 14, and a preliminary estimate of the event's fluence is ~ 18 +/- 4 Jyms.

660,ATEL #11672,"Variables We have performed Swift follow-up observations of the AM CVn-type system SDSS J141118.31+481257.6 after its first detected optical outburst (ATel #11668). We observed the object on 2018-May-24 and 2018-May-26 in X-rays and UV (~1 ks each observation). The binary was found to have magnitudes of 15.06 +/- 0.06 and 16.00 +/- 0.10 in UVM2 (in the Vega-photometric system), respectively. It has faded by ~4.5 mags in that UV filter since 2018-May-22, indicating that it is going back to quiescence. While the UV brightness of the object has decreased, its X-ray count rate has increased. We measured count rates in the 0.3-10 keV band of (2.2 +/- 0.5)E-02 cts/s and (4.7 +/- 0.8)E-02 cts/s, respectively. There is therefore an increase by a factor of 2.9 in the X-ray flux since 2018-May-23, suggesting that the accretion flow has become optically thin. We are grateful to the Swift team for its fast response to our ToO request."
661,ATEL #11667,"We report the spectroscopic classification of SN 2018bwq (RA=21:29:11.76, DEC=-29:09:46.2) in the galaxy 2MASX J21291210-2909468. The candidate was discovered by the SkyMapper Transient (SMT) survey (Scalzo et al. 2017, PASA, 34:30) on UT 2018-05-13 15:34 UT at ~19.32 mag in the r-band. SMT utilizes the 268-Mpix camera on the SkyMapper 1.3-m telescope at Siding Spring Observatory near Coonabarabran, NSW, Australia (Keller et al., 2007, PASA, 24, 1). The object was photometrically discovered by citizen scientists as part of the Zooniverse Supernova Sighting Project. Observations were performed on the 3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory on 2018-05-22 16:29 UT, using KOALA+AAOmega and grisms 580V+385R (3700-5700A and 6100-9300A). Classification was done with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024), and the spectrum is available at the IAU Transient Name Server (see  ). The spectrum shows the Si II 6355A absorption, and MgII, and FeII absorption features characteristic of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). SNID gives a reasonable fit to all its main spectral features with spectra of normal and 91T-like SNe Ia a few days before peak brightness placed at redshift ~0.08, consistently with that of the host galaxy (0.084). We measure a Si II 6355 velocity of -9,500 km/s. Survey Name | IAU Name | RA (J2000) | Dec (J2000) | Disc.

662,ATEL #11668,"Variables We report Swift observations of the AM CVn-type system SDSS J141118.31+481257.6 (RA=14:11:18.31, Dec=+48:12:57.6) during its first ever recorded outburst. The system was detected by Tadashi Kojima on 2018-May-20 with a V magnitude of 12.6 +- 0.2 ( ), an increase of ~7 mags compared to any previous measurement in the same filter. Using the XRT and UVOT instruments, we performed short observations (~1ks each) from 2018-May-21 to 2018-May-23. The source was found to have an X-ray count rate in the 0.3-10 keV band of (3.8 +/- 0.7)E-02 cts/s, (3.0 +/- 0.6)E-02 cts/s and (1.6 +/- 0.5)E-02 cts/s, respectively. In quiescence, the system has a count rate of (3.3 +/- 1.1)E-03 cts/s in the same energy band (Evans et al. 2014). On the Swift/UVOT Vega-based photometric system, the object had <11 mags (saturated) in the filter UVW1 on 2018-May-21, 11.53 +/- 0.02 mags in the UVM2 filter on 2018-May-22, and 12.38 +/- 0.02 mags also in UVM2 on 2018-May-23 (magnitudes are uncorrected for Galactic reddening). A comparison to archival observations taken during quiescence shows that the system was brighter by at least 7 mags in UVW1 on 2018-May-21, and it is currently brighter by ~5.3 mags in UVM2. During outburst, the increase in the optical and UV flux is much higher than in the X-ray flux. This suggests that the system is in a high state with an optically thick accretion flow. However, the current fluxes have decreased compared to the ones of 2018-May-21 and May-22, indicating that the object might be returning to quiescence. We thank the Swift team for approving and promptly executing the ToO."

No significant changes were seen between the May 6 and May 19 observations. Excitation of the emission line gas was fairly low during this period with C I, N I, O I lines were still present in the spectrum and the He I lines just emerging. The strongest emission features were H-alpha and the O I lines at 0.8446 and 1.1287 microns. The latter transitions are excited by Lyman Beta fluorescence and their relative strengths, together with the O I transition at 1.3165 microns, indicate a reddening value of E(B-V) = 0.55 +- 0.15. This extinction is interstellar in origin as there was no indication of dust present in the nova ejecta. Line widths were approximately 1400 km/sec as measured from their full width half maxima."

669,ATEL #11664,"We report of Swift observations of 2MASS J070931-353746 which was discovered as a bright X-ray source during an XMM slew on 2018-April-26. Compared with the flux seen during the ROSAT All Sky Survey (Voges et al. 1999) the source appeared to be brighter by a factor of about 16. We performed a short 1ks Swift observation of 2MASS J070931-353746 on 2018-May-18. The X-ray spectral analysis found a rather flat X-ray spectrum with Gamma=1.55+/-0.25 and a flux in the 0.3-10 keV band of (5.27+/-0.81)e-15 W m^-2, which is comparable to the flux found during the XMM slew. 2MASS J070931.8-353746 had previously been observed by Swift as part of a fillin program to follow sources detected in the Second Palermo BAT survey (Cusumano et al. 2010, A&A 524, 64) in 2013 July. During these observations the source appeared to be brighter by a factor of 2 compared with our most recent observation. The UVOT enhanced X-ray position (Goad et al. 2007, A&A 476, 1401; Evans et al., 2009, MNRAS 397, 1177) based on all XRT observation is Ra-2000=07 09 31.8, Dec-2000= -35 37 47.8 with an uncertainty of 2.0"". We observed in all 6 UVOT filters and found the following observed magnitudes in the Vega system (uncorrected for Galactic reddening): V=16.49+/-0.09, B=17.17+/-0.08, U=16.42+/-0.07. UVW1=16.61+/-0.08, UVM2=17.28+/-0.11, UVW2=17.30+/-0.08. During the observations in 2013 July 2MASS J070931-353746 was observed only in U, W1, and M2 and appeared to be fainter by 0.3mag, 0.4mag, and 0.2mag, respectively. The Galactic reddening in the direction of 2MASS J070931-353746 is E(B-V) = 0.350 mag (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011, ApJ 737, 103). We would like to thank Brad Cenko for approving our Swift ToO request and the Swift team for scheduling and executing the ToO quickly."
670,ATEL #11666,In Atel #11665 we reported the wrong RA coordinate for the transient DLT18x/AT 2018bwo. The correct coordinates for the transient are -- RA: 00:14:01.68 DEC: -23:11:35.38. We apologize for any inconvenience.
671,ATEL #11665,"We report the discovery of DLT18x/AT 2018bwo, which was first imaged by the PROMPT5 0.41m telescope at CTIO on 2018 May 22.42 (UT) at r~16.4 mag during the ongoing D<40 Mpc (DLT40) sub-day cadence supernova search. A confirmation image was obtained on 2018 May 22.81 (UT) with the PROMPT telescope at Meckering Observatory, with an r~16.23 mag. DLT18x is located at RA: 03:30:25.27 DEC: -23:11:35.38 (~4.6 arcmin from the potential host galaxy NGC45). Given the distance to NGC45 (D~7 Mpc), DLT8x is at an absolute magnitude of M_V~-12.8 mag, which means this transient could be either a young supernova, or a luminous blue variable in outburst. We do not detect the transient on 2018 May 16.35 (UT) or in prior imaging of the field. All images were taken in a 'Clear' (PROMPT5) or 'Open' (PROMPT-MO) filter which was calibrated to an approximate r-band magnitude. Further observations are encouraged."
672,ATEL #11658,"In the framework of our EXor monitoring programme dubbed EXORCISM (EXOR OptiCal and Infrared Systematic Monitoring - Antoniucci et al. 2013 PPVI, Lorenzetti et al. 2007 ApJ 665, 1182; Lorenzetti et al. 2009 ApJ 693, 1056), we observed the object VES263 signalled by a recent GAIA alert (<a href="" ""> </a>) as ""an emission line star undergoing repeat outbursts"" having detected an alerting magnitude of 11.66 wrt a historic magnitude of 12.16. VES263 is located in the Cyg OB2 association [R.A.(J2000) = 20:31:48.84 DEC(J2000) = 40:37:59.9], embedded in a region strongly affected by dust obscuration. It is an entry of both the H&alpha; line emission catalog (SpT B1II - Kohoutek & Wehmeyer 1999 AASupp.Ser, 134, 255), and the Cyg OB2 imaging survey (B=14.18 - Comeron & Pasquali 2012 AA,543A, 101). VES263 is identified as 2MASS 203148.845 +403800.10 (J=9.551, H=9.110, K=8.895) and WISE J203148.84+403759.9 (3.4&mu;m=8.581, 4.6&mu;m=8.496, 12.0&mu;m=8.575, 22.0&mu;m>8.148). Our photometry has been obtained on 2016 April 26 with the DOLORES@TNG Italian Telescope at La Palma (Canary Islands): B=15.09, V=12.96, R=11.69 I=10.22. Fluctuations of about 1 mag wrt previous determinations are clearly recognizable, as also shown by the <a href="" ""> Spectral Energy Distribution </a>, in which black points are the observational data (bands from B to WISE12 &mu;m), while red points represent a B1 main sequence star (normalized to the V-band). On the same date we obtained a <a href="" "">low-resolution optical spectrum</a>, as well. As expected, H&alpha; is seen in emission, while the other HI lines as well as NaI are in absorption. H&alpha; integrated flux 2E-13 erg/cm-2/s) provides a value for the mass accretion rate of (6.0 &plusmn; 1)E-8 M_sun/yr, by applying the relationship given by Gullbring et al. 1998, ApJ 492, 323 and adopting M=1M_sun and R=3 R_sun for the stellar mass and radius, respectively. Notably, the accretion rate linearly decreases with the increasing stellar ratio (mass/radius). According to the GAIA DR2, we obtained a distance value of 1680 pc. The observational results (SpT=B1, H&alpha; emission, obscuration by dust within a star forming region, presence of IR excess) all contribute to speculate VES263 is a young Herbig Be star, although it does not look like a true emission lines star. Further monitoring (at optical and IR frequencies) both photometric and spectroscopic, is in order to ascertain the real nature of VES263. In particular, whether or not its intermittent brightness is driven by a variable mass accretion rate."

678,ATEL #11652,"MAXI J1535-571 is a black-hole candidate in a low-mass X-ray binary that was detected independently by Swift and MAXI in outburst in early 2017 September (GCN #21792, ATel #10699). The source transitioned to a soft state in late 2017 November (ATel #11020) and was reported to transition back to its hard state around 2018 April 30 (ATel #11611). More recent Swift/X-ray Telescope (XRT) observations of the source in the hard state indicated that the source was decaying. On 2018 May 11 the source exhibited a minimum observed flux of ~1.2E-12 erg/cm<sup>2</sup>/s (0.5-10 keV; unabsorbed). However, the following XRT observation, carried out on 2018 May 14 (intermittently between 08:42 and 13:37 UT), showed that the flux had increased by a factor of ~20 to ~2.4E-11 erg/cm<sup>2</sup>/s (0.5-10 keV; unabsorbed). We fitted the spectrum from this observation with an absorbed power-law model. We fixed the equivalent hydrogen column density Nh to 4.4E22 cm<sup>-2</sup> (obtained by fitting data with higher signal-to-noise ratio; see ATel #11611). The spectrum corresponded to a photon index of &Gamma; = 1.7 +/- 0.3, indicating that the source was still in the hard state. Around the same time as this initial X-ray re-brightening, we observed MAXI J1535-571 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) on 2018 May 14 (between 16:11 and 21:48 UT). These observations were taken at 5.5 and 9 GHz (simultaneously) with a bandwidth of 2 GHz at each frequency. We used PKS 1934-638 for primary calibration and 1520-58 for phase calibration. Following standard procedure in CASA (v4.7.2; McMullin et al. 2007, ASPC, 376, 127) the data were reduced then imaged (using natural weighting). We significantly detected the source at both frequencies. Fitting a point source in the image plane we measure flux densities of 0.89 +/- 0.02 mJy at 5.5 GHz and 1.04 +/- 0.02 mJy at 9 GHz. The radio spectral index of &alpha; = 0.3 +/- 0.1, where S<sub>nu</sub> &prop; nu<sup>&alpha;</sup>, is consistent with emission from a compact jet during a hard X-ray state. The most recent XRT observation, observed on 2018 May 18 (intermittently between 02:28 and 12:04 UT), indicated that the source had brightened further, by a factor of ~400 corresponding to a flux of ~9.8E-9 erg/cm<sup>2</sup>/s (0.5-10 keV; unabsorbed). The spectrum was fit by a photon index of &Gamma; = 4.7 +/- 0.2 (Nh fixed to 4.4E22 cm<sup>-2</sup>), indicating that the source may have transitioned to a soft state. Close in time to this second XRT observation, we observed MAXI J1535-571 with ATCA and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The ATCA observations were taken on 2018 May 17 (between 06:54 and 11:00 UT) and followed the same setup and procedures described above. With these radio observations, we do not detect the source at either 5.5 or 9 GHz, with 3-sigma upper-limits of 0.06 mJy/beam at 5.5 GHz and 0.1 mJy/beam at 9 GHz. The source was also not detected in our quasi-simultaneous ALMA observations, which were taken at 97, 140 and 230 GHz, with 8 GHz of bandwidth at each frequency. All three bands were observed on May 17, where the 97 GHz observations were taken between 01:42 and 02:02 UT, the 140 GHz observations between 08:03 and 08:30 UT, and the 230 GHz observations between 01:09 and 01:41 UT. All three ALMA observations provide preliminary 3-sigma upper limits of 0.075 mJy/beam in all three bands. These non-detections imply the compact jet was quenched, as expected during the soft X-ray spectral state. Our current XRT campaign will continue to observe MAXI J1535-571 until 2018 May 30. We will request further XRT observations if the source remains X-ray active. We will also continue to monitor this source at radio frequencies. We thank Swift, ATCA, and ALMA for scheduling these observations."

The redshift is consistent with that of a tentative narrow H-alpha line likely from the host galaxy. Its very blue continuum and the ASAS-SN light curve also suggest that it is pre- or near maximum. The absolute optical magnitude is about -20.7, which is consistent with a SLSN-I before or near the peak.

681,ATEL #11649,"ASASSN-17mt (Nova Vel 2017) was discovered on 2017 September 24.39 (ATEL #10772). A weak &gamma;-ray source was subsequently detected by Fermi-LAT starting on 2017 October 24 (ATEL #10977). X-ray data collected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory between 2017 November and 2018 January showed a faint source (mean count rate = 0.05 count s<sup>-1</sup>), heavily absorbed [N<sub>H</sub> = (2.0 +0.3/-0.4)&times;10<sup>22</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> if fitted with an optically-thin APEC of kT = 1.6 +0.3/-0.2 keV]. Photometry from the dual-channel photometer on the 1.3m telescope of SMARTS shows no obvious sign of dust formation between days 70 and 240 after discovery. Spectra obtained with the Chiron echelle spectrograph (R=27,800) on the SMARTS 1.5m telescope show the evolution from an optically-thick Fe II spectrum with multiple absorption systems in December into a nebular spectrum in April/May. The emission lines of H and He have narrow central cores superposed on the normal double-horned profiles. Prominent forbidden lines include [N II], [Fe VII], [Fe X], and [Ca V]. [O III] 4959/5007 is very weak. Following the detection of [Fe X] emission, a Swift observation was requested in order to determine whether a super-soft source had become detectable, as the presence of [Fe X] can suggest. 1 ks of data was obtained on 2018 May 16 (234 days after discovery), showing enhanced emission below ~0.8 keV. While there are only 28 source counts in the spectrum, this suggests the emergence of a new, soft component, which can be approximately parameterised with a blackbody of temperature kT = 28 +57/-19 eV, together with APEC kT > 2.4 keV and a decreased, although poorly constrained, column density of N<sub>H</sub> = (3.5 +5.9/-3.4)&times;10<sup>21</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>. The 0.3-10 keV observed (unabsorbed) flux from this fit is 1.7&times;10<sup>-12</sup> (6.2&times;10<sup>-11</sup>) erg cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>; the BB component contributes 2.1&times;10<sup>-13</sup> erg cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> of the observed flux. The UVOT magnitudes obtained on May 16 are u = 14.65 &plusmn; 0.04, uvw1 = 15.64 &plusmn; 0.06, uvm2 = 18.09 &plusmn; 0.16 and uvw2 = 16.64 &plusmn; 0.08. OIR magnitudes from May 15 are B = 14.56, V = 13.80, R = 11.91, I = 12.10, J = 9.91, H = 9.46 and K = 8.45, with uncertainties of 0.02 mag at J, and < 0.01 mag elsewhere. The Swift UVOT photometry shows a pronounced minimum in uvm2 (2246 &Aring;) which may be due to the bump in the Galactic reddening law. The photometry in the three UV and u bands forms a straight slope when adopting a reddening correction using the Cardelli law with E(B-V) = 1.0 &plusmn; 0.1 (Rv = 3.1).

683,ATEL #11651,"We obtained an optical spectrum (range 350-890 nm) of SN 2018bsn, discovered by the Tsinghua-NAOC Transient Survey (TNTS), on UT May 17.7 2018 with the 2.4 m telescope (LJT + YFOSC) at Lijiang Observatory of Yunnan Observatories (YNAO). The spectrum is consistent with a type Ia supernova at a few days before the maximum light. Cross-correlation with a library of supernova spectra using the ""Supernova Identification"" code (SNID; Blondin and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows that it matches with SN 1989B at t = -7 days from the maximum light. After correcting for a redshift of 0.059 for its host galaxy 2MASX J14572815+0550375, an expansion velocity of about 14,000 km/s can be derived from the absorption minimum of Si II 635.5 nm.

684,ATEL #11646,"Following the detection of CXOU J173324.6-332321 as a new transient X-ray source in the globular cluster Liller 1 (ATel #11598), we acquired radio observations with the VLA to classify the source via its radio emission. The VLA was on source (in its most extended, A configuration), targeting near the Chandra X-ray position, between 06:22:49-07:07:36 UTC on 2018 May 14 (MJD~58252.28) with a total exposure of 26 min. We took data using two 2048-MHz basebands centred at 9 and 11 GHz. The source was observed at low elevations (~12-16 degrees), elongating the radio beam to 1.0x0.21 arcseconds (at a position angle of -31 deg) at 10 GHz. We marginally detected an unresolved point source combining both basebands. Fitting the data to a point source model in the image plane, we derive a preliminary flux density of 19.3 +/- 5.3 &mu;Jy/beam across 8-12 GHz. The luminosity of the radio source (L_R = &nu; L_&nu;) is 7.8e27 (d/8.2 kpc)^2 at 5 GHz, where we assume a flat radio spectral index and d is the distance to the source (scaled to the Harris 1996, AJ, 112, 1487; 2010 edition distance of Liller 1). This source is preliminarily located at</br> RA=17h:33:24.5931 +/- 0.0039s</br> Dec=-33:23:20.65 +/- 0.12 ""</br>, 0.8"" away from the Chandra position (which had an absolute astrometric error of 0.6""). Based on the X-ray positions in Homan et al. (2018; ATel #11598) and the radio position of the Rapid Burster from Moore et al. (2000; ApJ 532, 1181), the X-ray position of CXOU J173324.6-332321 is RA=17h:33:24.61 +/- 0.007s</br> Dec=-33:23:21.2 +/- 0.1""</br>. Since the radio detection is <5-sigma and outside the corrected 3-sigma (0.3"") confidence interval of CXOU J173324.6-332321, we are equivocal about whether the radio source we detect is real and, if real, whether the radio source is associated with CXOU J173324.6-332321. As part of the MAVERIC project of deep radio continuum imaging of Galactic globular clusters, we serendipitously obtained (A configuration) VLA data in two subbands centered at 5.0 and 7.0 GHz preceding the outburst of CXOU J173324.6-332321 on UT April 9 (10:03-11:33). There is no source consistent with the position of the CXOU J173324.6-332321 or the marginally detected 10 GHz radio source discussed above in a stacked image at a mean frequency of 6.0 GHz (rms noise 3.0 &micro;Jy/beam). Hence, on 2018 April 9 we set a 3-sigma upper limit of 9.0 &micro;Jy on the flux density of a radio source associated with CXOU J173324.6-332321. We obtained Swift/XRT observations on 2018 May 15, nearly contemporaneous with the VLA observation. The source is about two times brighter in X-rays than in the observation on 2018 May 06, suggesting either a re-brightening of CXOU J173324.6-332321 or contamination of the XRT light curve from a separate, new outburst from the Rapid Burster (or a new transient). Fitting the new observations with an absorbed power law, we find L_X = 4.7(-0.6/+1.2) e35 erg/s (1-10 keV), with N_H = 3.8(-1.2/+1.5)e22 cm^-2 and a photon index of 1.8(-/+0.5). These values are consistent with the (Chandra) values reported in ATel #11598. To make a preliminary classification of the source, we place this object on the L_R-L_X plane (e.g., Tudor et al. 2017, MNRAS, 470, 324). We note that a 3-sigma upper limit to the flux density of 15 &micro;Jy yields a less conservative upper limit of 6.0e27 (d/8.2 kpc)^2 erg/s at 5 GHz (compared to the marginal 7.8e29 erg/s source noted above). Based on either of these values and the Swift X-ray luminosity, this transient is inconsistent with black hole X-ray binaries but is consistent with measurements or limits from hard state neutron star binaries (see the linked figure below). Hence, we conclude that CXOU J173324.6-332321 is likely to be a neutron star X-ray binary. We thank NRAO for awarding Director's Discretionary Time and rapidly scheduling our observations, as well as Swift for its continued monitoring of this source's outburst.

Janksy Very Large Array (VLA) and the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA). We began monitoring V392 Per with the VLA on 2018 April 30, approximately one day after the nova was discovered. To date, we have 3 epochs with the VLA. We have observed with both L-band (1-2 GHz) and C-band (4-8 GHz). Our bandwidth at L-band is 1 GHz, and our bandwidth at C-band is 4 GHz. We split each band into 2 side-bands for better spectral coverage. The total time on source for each observation is about 10 minutes for L-band and 8 minutes for C-band. We began monitoring the nova with the AMI-LA on 2018 May 11, about 12 days after it was discovered. Our AMI-LA observations are at 15.5 GHz with 5 GHz of total bandwidth.

Using our C-band observations, an ejecta expansion velocity of 4000 km/s (ATel #11605), and a distance of 3.9 kpc (<A href="" "">Darnley & Starrfield 2018</a>), we estimate a brightness temperature on the order of 10^5 K. The expected brightness temperature for nova ejecta emitting via thermal bremsstrahlung is 10^4 K. We therefore suspect there is significant contribution from synchrotron emission, most likely related to the shocks that produced the population of accelerated particles necessary for the detected gamma-ray emission (ATel #11590). We will continue to monitor this source at radio frequencies, including upcoming observations with very long baseline interferometers. We encourage additional monitoring at all possible wavelengths.

Preliminary analysis indicates that on 2018 May 14, PKS 0903-57 was in a high state with a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV) of (2.2+/-0.2) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty only), about 55 times greater than its four-year average flux reported in the 3FGL catalog. This is the highest flux level observed since the start of the Fermi LAT survey. The corresponding photon spectral index (E>100 MeV) of 2.0+/-0.1 (statistical uncertainty only) is harder than the 3FGL catalog value of 2.25+/-0.05. The peak 6-hour integrated gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV) of (2.8+/-0.5) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 was reached by PKS 0903-57 in the interval 12:00-18:00 UT, with corresponding photon spectral index of 1.8+/-0.1. This is the second time that the Fermi-LAT Collaboration has announced flaring GeV gamma-ray behavior from PKS 0903-57 (see ATel#7704). PKS 0346-27 with VLBI radio coordinates (J2000.0) R.A.: 57.158935 deg, Dec.: -27.820434 deg (Beasley et al. 2002, ApJS, 141, 13) is a flat spectrum radio quasar with redshift z=0.991 (White et al. 1988 ApJ, 327, 561). Preliminary analysis indicates that on 2018 May 13, PKS 0346-27 was in a high state with a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV) of (1.4+/-0.2) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1, about 150 times greater than its four-year average flux reported in the 3FGL catalog. This is the highest flux level observed since the start of the Fermi LAT survey. The corresponding photon spectral index (E>100 MeV) of 1.9+/-0.1 is significantly harder than the 3FGL catalog value of 2.38+/-0.12. On May 14, 2018 the daily averaged flux is (0.7+/-0.1)e-6 with corresponding photon spectral index of 1.8+/-0.1. At least one photon of 30.3 GeV energy is detected in this day to be preliminary consistent with this source. This is the second time that the Fermi-LAT Collaboration has announced flaring GeV gamma-ray behavior from PKS 0346-27 (see ATel#11251). These two sources are members of the ""LAT Monitored Sources"", with preliminary, uncalibrated estimations of the daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi LAT publicly available respectively at   and at   . In consideration of the ongoing gamma-ray activity of this source, we encourage multiwavelength observations. The Fermi LAT contact person for PKS 0903-57 is B. Carpenter (carpbr01@gmail.com). The Fermi LAT contact person for PKS 0346-27 is R. Angioni (angioni@mpifr-bonn.mpg.de). The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden."
689,ATEL #11645,"We report light curve observations of the near-Earth asteroid 2015 DP155 which is on the NASA's list of potential future space mission targets (NHATS). It was first observed at Pan-STARRS 1, Haleakala, on 2015, February 17 and has been classified by the Minor Planet Center as a potentially hazardous asteroid. 2015 DP155 will pass within 0.023 AU (approximately nine mean lunar distances) on 2018, June 11; this is its closest encounter with Earth since 1959. Goldstone radar observations of this object are scheduled on 2018, June 4-17. A forced photometry of 2015 DP155 was carried out with the 0.6-m Cassegrain telescope (Zeiss-600) at the Terskol Observatory on 2018, May 1-7 when the object had a visual magnitude of about 18.9 and its phase angle ranged from 70.4 to 74.0 degrees. Analysis of datasets obtained allowed us to derive a rotation period of 3.105 &plusmn; 0.004 h. The composite light curve of 2015 DP155 which is shown in <a href=' '>Fig.1</a> indicates an amplitude of about 1 mag. Taking into account that the Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB; Warner et al., 2009, 2018 March 7 update) does not contain any previously results for 2015 DP155, our findings appear to be the first reported information on the rotation period of this near-Earth object."

694,ATEL #11636,"We analyzed the MAXI observation of the long type-I X-ray burst from SAX J1712.6-3739 reported by Lin & Yu (ATel #11623, 2018). MAXI observed the region of SAX J1712.6-3739 during 09:25:38 to 09:26:58 UT May 8th 2018 which is about 8 minutes after the peak observed with Swift/BAT (at 09:18:12 UT according to Lin & Yu 2018). We found that the 4 - 10 keV flux of this region reached 1.6 +/- 0.2 Crab. The spectrum of this scan transit is well fitted by an absorbed blackbody model with a temperature of kT = 1.9 (+0.3, -0.2) keV. The hydrogen column density was fixed at 1.3 x 10<sup>22 </sup>cm<sup>-2</sup> (Fiocchi et al. 2008, A&A 477, 239). Assuming a distance of 7 kpc which is based on the peak flux of previous type-I X-ray burst (Cocchi et al. 2001, MmSAI 72, 757), the unabsorbed bolometric luminosity reached 2.0 (+/- 0.3) x 10<sup>38</sup> erg/s. Therefore, the X-ray luminosity remained close to the theoretical Eddington luminosity of a typical 1.4 solar mass neutron star with a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere (2.5 x 10<sup>38</sup> erg/s) for 8 minutes between the peak of the burst observed by Swift/BAT (Lin & Yu 2018) and the MAXI observation. Since the X-ray flux decreased to about 70 mCrab (which is almost the detection limit of one MAXI scan transit) at the next scan transit of MAXI (92 minutes after), the upper limit of the e-folding decay time is less than 2000 sec. The estimated duration is shorter than all but perhaps one previously observed superbursts (e.g., in 't Zand 2017, Proc. '7 years of MAXI: Monitoring X-ray Transients', eds. M. Serino et al., RIKEN, 121), but consistent with many intermediate duration bursts (e.g., Serino et al. 2016, PASJ 68, 95). On the basis of these results, we suggest that this is an intermediate-duration burst defined in Cumming et al. (2006, ApJ 646, 429) and Falanga et al. (2008, A&A 48, 43)."

706,ATEL #11623,"SAX J1712.6-3739 was discovered by BeppoSAX/WFC in 1999 and a type I X-ray burst was detected with an unabsorbed bolometric flux of (5.1+/-0.5) x 10^-8 ergs/cm^2/s, which led to its identification of a neutron star LMXB and the estimate of its distance of ~7 kpc, by assuming a neutron star with 1.4 solar mass ( Cocchi et al. 2001). It was later classified as a persistent source by Fiocchi et al. (2008) and it is likely an ultracompact X-ray binary candidate (in't Zand et al., 2007; Fiocchi et al., 2008). By investigating the orbital monitoring data of Swift/BAT, we found the 15-50 keV X-ray intensity of SAX J1712.6-3739 rose to 845.7+/-63.0 mCrab on May 8th, 2018 at 09:18:12 UT, then declined to 148.0+/-31.0 mCrab at 09:24:44 UT and to 87.8+/-23.8 mCrab at 09:32:36 UT on the same day. The peak bolometric luminosity (0.1-100 keV), if estimated as a thermonuclear burst by assuming a black body temperature of 3 keV and a distance of 7 kpc, is about 2.3x10^38 erg/s, roughly corresponding to the Eddington luminosity of a neutron star. This favors the identification of the X-ray flare as a thermonuclear burst. The hard X-ray burst last more than 860 seconds based on BAT monitoring in the 15-50 keV band. This is much longer than those of typical type I bursts. The hard X-ray flux declined with an e-folding decay time around 260+/-78 seconds, which is also much shorter than the typical e-folding decay time of superbursts based the measurements in the soft X-ray energy band (typically 3-20 keV) (see, for example, Atel #8253; Atel #9882; Atel #11422). Ballantyne & Strohmayer (2004) and Keek et al. (2014) showed that the blackbody temperature of the X-ray spectrum during superbursts in 4U 1820-30 and 4U 1636-536 decreased from ~3 keV to below 2 keV in the first few thousand seconds, corresponding to the decrease in the ratio between the X-ray flux in the 15-50 keV band to that in the 3-20 keV band by a factor of 5, from about 0.30 to 0.06. The e-folding decay time of the X-ray flare as seen in the soft X-ray band would be at least 5 times longer. Therefore the hard X-ray flare detected by Swift/BAT would correspond to a superburst event in the direction of the ultracompact LMXB candidate SAX J1712.6-3739. X-ray observations of the source are highly encouraged."
707,ATEL #11624,"Optical observations of the flat-spectrum radio quasar Ton 599 (4C 29.45, PKS 1156+295; z=0.7) with the Automatic Telescope for Optical Monitoring (ATOM) show a bright optical state. R-band observations conducted between 21 March 2018 and 8 May 2018 with ATOM reveal a continuous increase in flux from magnitude 15 to 13 &ndash; the highest recorded with ATOM since 2006. This includes rapid brightening by 0.5 magnitudes over 24 hours (between MJD 58245.4 and 58246.4). Ton 599 has recently shown increased activity in November 2017 in gamma-ray (ATel #10931, #10937) and optical bands (ATel #10948). Following that event, it has also been detected by Cherenkov telescopes in December (ATel #11061, #11075). Furthermore, ATOM observations of the flat-spectrum radio-quasar 3C 345 (PKS 1641+399; z=0.6) also show an increase in optical flux. R-band observations conducted between 10 April 2018 and 8 May 2018 show an increase from magnitude 17.2 to 16.0. This is the brightest optical state since 2010. A previous bright gamma-ray state has been observed in May/June 2017 with Fermi-LAT (ATel #10453) &ndash; which, however, was not accompanied by a significant optical counter-part.

The Crab pulsar is regularly monitored with the 42-ft and Lovell telescopes at the Jodrell Bank Observatory as part of the pulsar timing programme. Initial analysis shows a fractional rotational spin-up of dF0/F0 = (4.08+/-0.22)E-9 and a fractional change in spin-down rate dF1/F1 = (0.46+/-0.11)E-3 (1 sigma errors). This glitch occurred 176 days after the previous glitch, which we measured to be the largest glitch ever observed in the Crab pulsar (ATEL #10939). At the time of the most recent glitch, the Crab pulsar was still in the recovery phase from the previous glitch. While the Crab pulsar is observed twice per day for a total of 11 hours, this glitch occurred between two of our observations. We currently constrain the glitch epoch to be MJD 58237.357+/-0.005. We are continuing to monitor this source, but follow-up observations are encouraged in order to help refine the glitch characteristics and also to identify any radiative effects seen at other wavelengths."

710,ATEL #11619,"The Chandra X-ray Observatory re-observed the field of GW170817 starting on May 3rd, 2018 as part of its on-going monitoring program (PI: Wilkes). Observations were split into two exposures of 50.7 ks and 46 ks, respectively. The X-ray afterglow is significantly detected at an average level of (8.5 +/- 1.4)E-04 cts/s, well below the value (14.8 +/- 1.1)E-04 cts/s measured at ~160 d after the merger (Troja & Piro, GCN Circ. 22374; Troja et al. 2018). The spectrum is well described by an absorbed power-law model with photon index 1.5 +/- 0.2, consistent with the value of 1.575 derived at earlier times from the broadband spectrum. By using this value we derive an unabsorbed X-ray flux of (1.4 +/- 0.2)E-14 erg/cm2/s (0.3-10 keV) at 260 days after the merger. The quoted errors are at the 68% confidence level. A comparison with the afterglow models derived in Troja et al. (2018) is shown at this link:   This new X-ray observation supports earlier claims (D'Avanzo et al. 2018; Dobie et al. 2018) that the afterglow entered its post-peak decay phase. However, no clear distinction between the competing models is possible. Further observations are critical to probe the structure of the relativistic outflow.

716,ATEL #11617,"On 2018 May 1th 20 UT (JD=2458240.333) we took spectroscopic data of the dwarf nova V392 Per (ATel #11588; ATel #11601; ATel #11605) with the echelle spectrograph FLECHAS (Mugrauer et al. 2014, AN 335, 417) at the 90cm telescope of the University Observatory Jena. The spectrum is the average of 3 spectra each with an integration time of 600s, covering the spectral range between 4200 and 8000&#8491 at a resolving power of R~7400. The spectrum is wavelength calibrated (RMS of is 41.8m&#8491) using spectra of a ThAr arc-lamp, which were taken directly before the spectroscopy of the dwarf nova. The spectrum of V392 Per is dominated by very broad emission features, exhibiting complex line profiles. Beside others the most prominent ones are those of Hydrogen (H&alpha;, H&beta;, and H&gamma;). The half-width of the H&alpha; emission line is determined to be 4600&plusmn250km/s. In addition, also strong absorption features are identified in the spectrum of V392 Per as those of the interstellar NaI-doublet (5890&#8491 & 5896&#8491) or of the diffuse interstellar bands at 5780&#8491, 5797&#8491, and 6614&#8491. Simultaneously with the spectroscopy, we also obtained photometric measurements of V392 Per with the CCD-imager CTK-II (Mugrauer 2016, AN 337, 226) in the B-, V- and R-band. We obtain B=8.61&plusmn0.05mag, V=7.83&plusmn0.05mag, and R=6.75&plusmn0.05mag, using the star BD+47 1026, as photometric reference."
717,ATEL #11618,"The Chandra X-ray Observatory started another round of follow-up observations of GW170817. The first observation (ID 21080) was taken on May 03, 2018 at 10:41:26 UT (t ~ 259 d after merger) for a total exposure time of 50.8 ks (PI Wilkes; program 19408644). We find that an X-ray source is detected at the location of GW170817 with a count-rate of (7.7 +/- 1.3)e-4 cts/s (0.5 - 8 keV) and 13.8-sigma significance. We modeled the spectrum with an absorbed simple power-law and find a best-fitting photon index, Gamma = 1.4 +/- 0.3 and no evidence for intrinsic absorption. The galactic neutral hydrogen column density in the direction of the transient is, N_H = 7.8E+20cm-2 (Kalberla et al., 2005). For these parameters, the unabsorbed flux is (1.3 +/- 0.3)e-14 ergs cm-2 s-1 (0.3 - 10 keV). A second observation (ID 21090) was acquired on May 05, 2018 at 01:25:30 UT (~ 261 days after merger) for a total exposure time of 46.0 ks. GW170817 is detected with 14.8-sigma significance and a count-rate of (8.3 +/- 1.4)e-4 cts/s (0.5 - 8 keV). The best-fitting photon-index is Gamma = 1.3 +/- 0.3. The corresponding unabsorbed flux is (1.5 +0.5/-0.3) e-14 ergs cm-2 s-1 (0.3 - 10 keV). The best fitting photon index from a joint spectral fit is Gamma = 1.43 +/- 0.15, consistent with the photon index measured at ~160 days. We conclude that there is no evidence for the passage of the synchrotron cooling frequency through the Chandra band. The total 0.5-8 keV count-rate inferred from the two observations is (8.0+/-0.9)e-4 cts/s. The X-ray source shows significant fading compared to the previous epoch at ~160 days (inferred rate of (1.50 +\-0.12)e-3 cts/s, Margutti et al., 2018). Applying a simple binomial test, we find that the detected fading is significant at a level > 4 sigma. We can thus reject the hypothesis of a random fluctuation of the X-ray count-rate, and conclude that these Chandra observations provide the first statistically significant evidence for a decaying X-ray emission from GW170817. We thank the entire Chandra team for making these observations possible."

719,ATEL #11614,"As part of our young stellar object (YSO) sub-mm monthly monitoring programme, the JCMT-Transient Survey (Herczeg et al. 2017 ApJ, 849, 43; Johnstone et al. 2018 ApJ, 854, 31), we are using SCUBA2 to monitor the 850 micron peak brightness of the YSO EC 53 (R.A. 18:29:51.2, Dec. +01:16:39.5) in Serpens Main (d=436 pc). The near-IR and sub-mm continuum emission are variable, with bursts that repeat every approximately 18 months (Hodapp et al. 2012, ApJ, 744, 56; Yoo et al. 2017, ApJ, 849, 69). Our recent measurements at 850 microns and at H- and K-band confirm that EC 53 is once again brightening. On March 30, 2018 the mean peak brightness of the source at 850 microns was 1.12 +/-0.02 Jy/bm, within the JCMT (15'') beam. On April 25, 2018 the mean peak brightness had risen to 1.26 +/- 0.03 Jy/bm, a ~12% increase over 25 days. While the absolute calibration of the JCMT is typically uncertain by about 10%, the relative calibration of the JCMT Transient Survey between epochs is significantly better, roughly 2% (Mairs et al. 2017 ApJ, 843, 55). Contemporaneous H-band photometry from the Liverpool Telescope and K-band photometry from UKIRT's Wide Field Camera (WFCAM) reveal that EC 53 has brightened by 0.8 mag in both bands over the last month. A finder chart and light curves at sub-mm and near-IR can be found at the URL linked below. The YSO EC 53 (Yoo et al. 2017; Hodapp et al. 2012) is classified as a Class I source yet remains embedded in a significant dust envelope. Hodapp et al. (2012) first recognized the source as periodic with a roughly 18 month period, based on near-IR K-band observations taken over many years. The periodicity in the light curve of EC 53 is hypothesized to be due to variations in the accretion rate onto the young stellar object, possibly mediated by a companion star or planet forming within EC 53’s surrounding accretion disk. Monitoring observations in the infrared, sub-mm/mm, and radio are highly encouraged as EC 53 proceeds through this burst. Peak brightness is anticipated somewhere between late May and early July, 2018. Determination of any significant lag between the near-IR brightening and the sub-mm brightening is essential for modelling the structure of the surrounding envelope. Near-IR spectra during this time are also desirable. EC 53&#39;s Light Curves and Location.:  "
720,ATEL #11611,"MAXI J1535-571 (ATels #10699, #10700, #10702, #10704, #10708, #10711, #10716) has been in a soft X-ray spectral state since late November (ATel #11020). The source has remained in this soft state down to X-ray luminosities much lower than typically seen (ATel #11568), and is currently below MAXI and BAT sensitivity limits. However, recent Swift-XRT observations (taken on 2018 April 26, April 30 and May 02, MJDs 58232, 58234 and 58240, respectively) show that the X-ray spectrum has now evolved significantly. The observations show a significant decrease in the soft X-ray emission and an increase in the hard X-ray emission. We measure a (3-7 keV)/(1-3 keV) colour ratio of 0.21+/-0.07, 0.9+/-0.3 and 3.8+/-1.4 on April 26, April 30 and May 02, respectively. We fit these three epochs with a simple absorbed power law with the N<sub>H</sub> fixed to 4.4E22 cm<sup>-2</sup> (determined by joint fitting these epochs with other higher signal-to-noise observations taken in the week preceding these marked spectral changes), to highlight changes in the spectrum. We find that the soft X-ray flux reduced steadily from ~2.7E-12 ergs/cm<sup>2</sup>/s to ~5.9E-13 ergs/cm<sup>2</sup>/s (absorbed 1-3 keV) over the observations, while the hard X-ray flux increased from ~5.7E-13 ergs/cm<sup>2</sup>/s to ~2.2E-12 ergs/cm<sup>2</sup>/s (absorbed 3-7 keV). Over these dates, the X-ray photon index evolved from 5+/-1 to 3.7+/-0.8, and then 1.6+/-0.6. We note that while there is an obvious trend in the data, the values of the absorbed fluxes and photon indices are poorly constrained (due to low count rates and a high degeneracy with the line-of-sight absorption, which has errors of 1.1E22 cm<sup>-2</sup> in our joint fitting). The addition of a disk blackbody component (which is preferred for the April 26 data) does not change the observed trend. Following this X-ray hardening, we performed ATCA radio observations of the source on 2018 May 03 21:46:09.9 UT to 22:39:09.9 UT (MJD 58241.92 +/- 0.02). These observations were taken simultaneously at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz, with a bandwidth of 2 GHz at each frequency. 1934-638 and 1520-58 were used for primary flux and phase calibration, respectively. The data were reduced and imaged following standard procedures in CASA (v4.7.2; McMullin et al. 2007). Imaging was carried out using natural weighting to maximise sensitivity. The radio counterpart was not detected at either frequency, with 3-sigma upper-limits of 165 uJy/beam at 5.5 GHz and 141 uJy/beam at 9 GHz. Stacking the two frequencies provides a 3-sigma upper-limit of 117 uJy/beam. A radio non-detection does not rule out an accretion state transition, as the compact jet typically switches on a few days later than the X-ray spectral changes, which themselves lag the change in X-ray timing properties by a few days (Kalemci et al. 2013). We will continue to monitor MAXI J1535-571 at radio frequencies. Further multiwavelength monitoring is strongly encouraged. We thank Swift and ATCA for scheduling these observations."

723,ATEL #11605,"We obtained two spectra of the Nova V392 Per (ATel #11588; ATel #11601) with the ESPERO echelle spectrograph (Bonev et al. 2017, BlgAJ 26, 67) at Rozhen observatory (Bulgaria), on 2018 May 1 18.74 UT and May 2 18.80 UT. The spectra cover the range of 4400-9000 &#8491; with a resolving power of ~30 000. The spectrum of the Nova is dominated by very broad emission lines with a complex shape. The strongest lines in our spectra are H&alpha;, H&beta;, FeII 42 multiplet, CaII IR triplet, OI 7774&#8491; and 8446&#8491;. HeI lines 5876&#8491; and 6677&#8491; are relatively weak with an obvious increase of the emission intensity during the second night. The FWHM measured for the H&alpha; and H&beta; emission lines is 5600&plusmn;200 km/s. In their profiles, three peaks with radial velocities of about -2000 km/s, -250 km/s and 1900 km/s are apparent. Weak P Cyg absorption components are also visible in the H&alpha; and H&beta; profiles. We measured the radial velocity to be about -4000 km/s for one absorption component in H&alpha; and about -3700 km/s and -4100 km/s for two absorptions in H&beta;. Three very weak absorptions of HeI 5876&#8491; with radial velocities of about -1350 km/s, -3035 km/s and -3350 km/s are also visible in the spectrum. The DIBs 5780&#8491;, 5797&#8491;, 6614&#8491; and the interstellar lines NaI and KI are very strong. The interstellar lines show two components with radial velocities -23.7&plusmn;1.5 km/s and 3.5&plusmn;0.3 km/s respectively. Using the relations of Munari & Zwitter (1997, A&A 318, 269) for KI (the NaI lines are saturated and not usable) and of Puspitarini et al.

724,ATEL #11606,"As part of a search programme for fast radio transients that is running at the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory, we have followed up the very bright FRB180309 (ATel #11387). Follow-up observations started less than 7 hours after the event, on 2018-03-09 at 09:34:51 UTC, pointing at the reported position centered at RA = 21:24:43.8, Dec = -33:58:44.5 (J2000), close to PSR J2124-3358. Two hours of data were recorded. The observations were conducted using the L-band receiver, with the Apollo backend sampling a bandwidth of 336 MHz, centred at 1564 MHz, with 0.5 MHz channel bandwidth. 8-bit filterbank files were produced with a sampling time of 256 us. We analysed the data using two single-pulse search pipelines. One pipeline is based on the Heimdall algorithm (Barsdell et al. 2011). For the second pipeline, we used algorithms from Astro-Accelerate ( ) that is part of the ongoing development of highly optimized fast transient search software for upcoming facilities like MeerKAT and the Square Kilometre Array. Our preliminary analyses using both pipelines show no events above a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 8 for widths between 0.256 - 655.36 ms (0.256 - 500 ms for AA) and dispersion measures (DMs) 0 - 5000 pc cm^-3 (0 - 750 pc cm^-3 for AA). The non-detection places an upper-limit on potential radio afterglow emission of 0.6 Jy ms for events of 1 ms duration. The limit takes into account the fraction of data corrupted by radio-frequency interference (RFI) and the contribution to the system temperature from ground spill-over caused by the low elevation of the field for the telescope. Additionally, we reprocessed about 4 hours of archival data of the field that were obtained during regular observations as part of the Jodrell Bank pulsar timing programme of PSR J2124-3358. These typically 15 minute long observations span the period from 2013-11-22 to a few days before the event (2018-03-05). Again, our preliminary analyses indicate no single-pulse events above a S/N of 8 (0.256 <= width <= 655.36 ms, 0 <= DM <= 5000 pc cm^-3), placing an upper-limit on previous outbursts of 0.6 Jy ms for events of 1 ms duration. This includes the same additional contributions as above. Follow-up observations of the field and further data analysis are ongoing. Part of this research was made possible by the ERC funded MeerTRAP project (grant no. 694745)."
725,ATEL #11607,"We report on SALT high-resolution spectroscopy of ASASSN-18ix which was reported as a possible Galactic nova by K. Z. Stanek et al. (ATel #11561). We obtained a 2000 s spectrum of this object under the SALT Large Science Program on transients on 2018 April 24.99 (HJD 2458233.50), using the High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS; Crause et al. 2014, Proc. SPIE, 91476) on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). Observations were taken in the Low Resolution (LR) mode of HRS, covering a spectral range of 3800-8900 &#8491; at a resolution of R = 14,000. The data were reduced with the SALT HRS MIDAS pipeline (Kniazev et al. 2016, MNRAS 459, 3068). The spectrum is dominated by weak emission lines of H I and He I (see below a full list of the line identification) superimposed on broad absorption lines, typical of dwarf novae on decline. The emission lines are characterized by a double peaked profiles, typical of an accretion disk, where the peaks are separated by ~320 &plusmn; 20 km/s. We measure a FWHM of ~550 &plusmn; 50 km/s for H&#946; and H&#945; emission lines. A dwarf nova classification is consistent with the evolution of the light-curve obtained by the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, Shappee et al. 2014). The light-curve shows a quick rise to the maximum followed by a fast decline, typical for that of dwarf novae (see below a table of magnitudes) and consistent with our spectrum, taken 3.5-4 days after maximum.

726,ATEL #11608,"In response to the detection of gamma-ray emission with the Fermi LAT instrument in the recent nova ASASSN-18fv (ATel #11546), we carried out a target-of-opportunity observation of the system with the NuSTAR observatory between 2018 April 20 and 2018 April 22. The total exposure time was ~64 ks. A simultaneous soft X-ray observation was carried out using the Swift satellite at the end of the NuSTAR exposure on 2018 April 22, lasting 1000s. The Swift observation utilized the XRT instrument in Windowed Timing mode, due to the high optical brightness of the nova. ASASSN-18fv was not detected in the Swift XRT observation, with a 3-sigma upper limit on the 0.3-10 keV count rate of 0.016 cts/s. The nova was, however, clearly detected in the NuSTAR image, with ~2350 net counts detected in a 50 arcsec circular region centered on the source in both the FPMA and FPMB instruments. We find that the nova spectrum is well fit by an absorbed thermal plasma model (phabs*apec in XSpec), consistent with a deeply embedded internal shock in the ejecta. The best fit energy of the plasma is kT = 7.8 +/- 1.5 keV. Absorption is seen to be strong enough to eliminate all photons below ~4 keV, requiring an equivalent hydrogen column density (Nh) of a few 10^24 cm^-2 if solar abundances are assumed. The observed flux was 3e-12 erg/s/cm^2 in the 3.5-78 keV range, and the implied unabsorbed flux was 1e-11 erg/s/cm^2. We find no evidence of non-thermal emission at high energies in the spectrum. Further X-ray observations of this nova are encouraged to monitor the evolution of this internal shock as the ejecta expand."
727,ATEL #11609,"We report on the detection of MAXI J1820+070 (e.g. ATel #11399, #11418, #11420) with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). Observations in the high band (115-189 MHz) were carried out from 2018 April 27 02:32:33.0-04:32:33.0 UTC (MJD 58235.106-58235.189). Using data from 115-166 MHz and the Prefactor calibration pipeline (e.g. van Weeren et al. 2016, ApJS, 223, 2), we generated a preliminary map with angular resolution 34.5"" x 20.3"" (beam position angle 33.2 deg). We detect an unresolved point source at the fitted position RA 18:20:21.9, Dec. +07:11:07, after initial first-order corrections for potential systematics in the astrometry. Moreover, the preliminary 140-MHz flux density is 42 +/- 5 mJy, determined with the MIRIAD task IMFIT; the fitting error and an estimated 10 per cent calibration error were combined in quadrature to obtain the overall uncertainty. The flux density scale is that of Scaife & Heald 2012 (MNRAS, 423, L30). Our LOFAR flux density further constrains the shape of the radio spectrum in the metre-wavelength regime, with our measurement being close in value to the VLITE detection at 339 MHz on 2018 April 12 (ATel #11540). MAXI J1820+070 was also observed by the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA), simultaneously with LOFAR, between 2018 April 27 02:07:27.3-05:05:12.5 UTC (MJD 58235.089-58235.212). The observation was performed over a 5-GHz bandwidth (4096 channels), with a central frequency of 15.5 GHz. The data were then binned into 8 broad frequency channels, and flagged and calibrated using the custom reduction pipeline reduce_dc (e.g. Perrott et al. 2013, MNRAS, 429, 3330). Additional flagging, and then cleaning, was done in CASA using natural weighting and a gain factor of 0.1. MAXI J1820+070 is clearly detected as an unresolved source in the image at RA 18:20:22, Dec. +07:11:11 (the synthesised beam major and minor axes are 60"" and 30"", respectively, with a beam position angle of 10.2 deg), with a flux density of 50 +/- 2 mJy determined using the CASA task IMFIT. The uncertainty includes the statistical fitting error and a 5 per cent calibration error. The instantaneous two-point spectral index, alpha, between 140 MHz and 15.5 GHz is therefore 0.04 +/- 0.03 (flux density S_nu proportional to nu<sup>alpha</sup>), a value that is consistent with previous reports of a near-flat radio spectrum (e.g. ATel #11439, #11539). We thank the ASTRON Radio Observatory for promptly scheduling our LOFAR observations and pre-processing the data. We also thank the MRAO staff for carrying out the AMI-LA observations."

733,ATEL #11603,"We report the results of spectral and timing analyses of NuSTAR (3-79 keV) and Swift (0.3-10 keV) observations of the accretion-powered millisecond pulsar Swift J1756.9-2508, performed during its recent April 2018 outburst (ATel #11497, #11502, #11505, #11523, #11566 and #11581). On our request the source was observed twice with NuSTAR on April 8 and 14, 2018 for 39.5 ks and 61 ks, respectively, and was monitored with the XRT aboard The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory every other day during the whole outburst (April 2-24, 2018; 10.2 ks exposure). The first NuSTAR observation was performed on April 8, 2018 starting at 08:31:09, when the source was already in the fading phase of the outburst. The source was significantly detected up to 70 keV allowing us to construct a broad-band spectrum for the first time. The closest Swift-XRT observation was performed on the same day (ObsID 00088662001; 2.2 ks) and was used to cover energies below 3 keV. The joint spectrum was fitted with an absorbed comptonized spectrum (phabs*compPS) under the assumption of a slab geometry. We obtained an excellent fit (red. chi^2=1.01; 1395 dof; NuSTAR FPM-A,B and Swift-XRT) with the following parameters: N<sub>H</sub>=(3.9 +/- 0.1)e22 cm^(-2), electron temperature kTe=(29.5 +/- 1.7) keV, Thomson optical depth tau_T=(2.0 +/- 0.1) and black body temperature frozen at kT<sub>bb</sub>=0.1 keV. Unabsorbed fluxes in 2-10 and 20-60 keV energy bands are F<sub>2-10</sub>=(2.20 +/- 0.5)e-10 and F<sub>20-60</sub>=(2.60 +/- 0.05)e-10 erg/(s cm^2), respectively. No evidence for an iron emission line was found. The second NuSTAR observation was taken about one week later on April 14, 2018 starting at 02:56:09, and the source was undetectable in the NuSTAR data in agreement with quasi-simultaneous Swift-XRT data. We also performed a timing analysis using NuSTAR data of the first April 8, 2018 observation. For this purpose a phase coherent timing model, composed of updated pulsar and orbital ephemerides, was constructed from NICER data covering the 3--11 April, 2018 period (see P.M. Bult et al., ATELs #11502 and #11581). Adopting the DE405 solar system ephemeris in the barycentering process we obtained in our 2 parameter optimisation procedure a pulse frequency of 182.06580384(4) Hz at Epoch MJD 58216 (TDB) and a time of ascending node Tasc of 58211.01753(6) MJD (TDB). Errors are at 1 sigma confidence level. In this procedure we kept the orbital period, Porb, projected orbital size, asini,fixed to the values given in MNRAS 403, 1426 (Patruno et al. (2010)). A 3 parameter optimisation with also Porb free gives a best fit value of 3282.35(10) s, fully consistent with the value given in MNRAS 403, 1426. Folding the NuSTAR timing data (using the latest clock correction information) on the updated ephemeris yielded highly significant pulsed emission up to ~50 keV: 3-10 keV 25.8 sigma, 10-20 keV 15.2 sigma and 20-60 keV 7.5 sigma, adopting a Z_2^2-test. The (background corrected) pulsed fractions are 6.2% for all three energy bands, consistent with the NICER findings (ATEL #11502). The pulse shape does not seem to be dependent on energy, and is fully compatible with the 3-10 keV NICER profile, though the NuSTAR pulse arrives +0.37(4) ms later than the NICER pulse (see   for the NICER and NuSTAR pulse profiles). We thank the NuSTAR and Swift teams for scheduling our ToO observations."
734,ATEL #11598,"We report on the discovery of a new X-ray transient in the globular cluster Liller 1 with Chandra. Swift/XRT monitoring observations of the globular cluster Liller 1 in early April 2018 revealed low-level activity (around 0.1 ct/s) in the core of the cluster. Liller 1 harbors the well-known transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary MXB 1730-335, also known as the Rapid Burster. An archival Chandra HRC-I observation of Liller 1 (Homer et al. 2001, ApJ, 122, 2627) indicates that in addition to the Rapid Burster, at least three other (low-luminosity) X-ray sources are present in the error circle of the Swift X-ray source. Type-II bursts (Lewin et al. 1976, ApJ, 207, L95), which would have identified the Swift source as the Rapid Burster, were not seen in the Swift observations (April 4, 9, 17, 20, 24, and 29) nor in follow-up NICER observations (April 20 and 22). Type-I bursts were not detected either. Prompted by the absence of type-II bursts, we triggered our Chandra program to identify possible new transients in globular clusters. Chandra observed Liller 1 with ACIS-S in 1/8 subarray mode for ~9 ks, starting on 2018 April 30 at 11:08 UT. Our observation reveals three X-ray sources in the core of Liller 1. The brightest of these sources, the current X-ray transient, does not show type-I or type-II bursts. Comparison with a reprocessed version of the archival Chandra HRC-I observation indicates that two of the sources in our ACIS-S observation can be matched with two of the low-luminosity X-ray sources (C2 and C3) reported by Homer et al. (2001). However, the third source detected in the ACIS-S image does not coincide with the Rapid Burster. As can be seen from the coordinates listed below, the offsets (ACIS-S minus HRC-I) are (delta_ra,delta_dec)=(+0.1'',-0.3'') for C2 and (+0.1'',-0.1'') for C3. This is consistent with the absolute pointing accuracy of Chandra (~0.6''). However, the current transient is shifted from the Rapid Burster by an angular distance that is substantially larger (+0.1'',-1.3''), indicating that the current transient corresponds to a previously unidentified X-ray source in Liller 1. <table> <tr> <th>ACIS-S</th> <th>R.A.</th> <th>Dec.</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Current Transient</td> <td>17:33:24.60</td> <td>-33:23:21.5</td> </tr> <tr> <td>C2</td> <td>17:33:24.16</td> <td>-33:23:22.1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>C3 <td>17:33:24.11</td> <td>-33:23:26.1</td> </tr> </table> <table> <tr> <th>HRC-I</th> <th>R.A.</th> <th>Dec.</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Rapid Burster</td> <td>17:33:24.59</td> <td>-33:23:20.1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>C2</td> <td>17:33:24.15</td> <td>-33:23:21.8</td> </tr> <tr> <td>C3 <td>17:33:24.10</td> <td>-33:23:26.0</td> </tr> </table> The formal errors on these coordinates (from wavdetect in CIAO 4.9) are less than 0.1'' in each direction. Following Chandra's naming convention, we refer to the new transient as CXOU J173324.6-332321. The 0.5-10 keV spectrum of the source can be well fit with an absorbed power law (when including Chandra's pile-up model). We find NH=3.8(2)e22 cm^-2, a power-law photon index of 1.9(1), and an unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV flux of 6.9(3)e-11 erg/cm^2/s. For a distance of 8.2 kpc (Harris 1996, AJ, 112, 1487), the 0.5-10 keV luminosity is 5.5(3)e35 erg/s. We note that at this luminosity the observed power-law index is consistent with either black hole or neutron star X-ray binaries (Wijnands et al. 2015, MNRAS, 454,1371). Finally, our results suggest that past low-level activity in Liller 1 (detected with all-sky monitors, or even the Swift/XRT) that was attributed to the Rapid Burster may have come from CXOU J173324.6-332321. We thank the Chandra staff for their help in executing this observation as soon as possible."

736,ATEL #11596,"I have observed the transient source MAXI J1820+070 in the optical since 2018 March 24. In the past two weeks, the source has started to show long-term variations in brightness of amplitude approximately 0.03 - 0.10 magnitude. Measurements made at the RIT Observatory, Rochester, NY, USA, using a 30-cm Meade LX200 telescope, no filter and ATIK 11000 CCD, between UT 2018 Apr 22 and UT 2018 May 02, can be fit by a rough sinusoid with period of about 0.1417 days = 3.4 hours. Since the source is only visible above the horizon for about 3 hours before dawn, it is difficult to separate intrinsic variability of a similar period from several systematic effects, especially color-dependent extinction. However, the increase in amplitude on UT 2018 May 02 makes the effect easier to detect. The period appears to be very close to one-seventh of a day, which leads to some ambiguity; a periodogram shows strong peaks at one-sixth and one-eighth of a day as well. In order to break this degeneracy, I added measurements made by Stephen M Brincat (BSM), at Flarestar Observatory, Malta, using a 25-cm Meade telescope, no filter, and Moravian G2-1600 CCD; these measurements kindly provided by the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO). Since this data was acquired at a longitude far from that of RIT, it distinguishes well between these signals. The data from BSM on UT 2018 May 01, combined with the three nights of RIT data, yield a good fit for a period of 0.1417 days. This period may be caused by the orbital motions of the members of the binary system. Further tests of this variation by other observers, and at other wavelengths, is welcome. Further details on the measurements and data reduction from RIT Observatory, as well as light curves and datafiles in ASCII format, can be found in the nightly report linked below.

The enhancement was recognized from 2018 April 23 (MJD 58231), and X-ray count rates in the 2-4 keV and 4-10 keV bands peaked on April 26 at 0.085 +/- 0.008 c/s/cm2 (~ 80 mCrab) and 0.096+/-0.008 c/s/cm2 (~ 82 mCrab), respectively. The hardness of the energy spectrum did not vary significantly during the outburst. The time-averaged energy spectrum on April 26-29 was well represented by an absorbed power-law with a photon index of 2.04 +/- 0.10 and a hydrogen column density nH of 0.3e22 fixed, and the 2-10 keV luminosity was 4.7e36 (d/4.9 kpc)^2 erg/s where d is the distance to the source (see Allen et al. 2018, ApJ, 854, 58, and references therein). No X-ray burst was observed. This is the second detection of the outbursts from this source with MAXI/GSC, and the first detection was in May, 2012 (Degenaar & Wijnalds 2013, IAU Symp. 291). Reanalysis of GSC data show that the peak count rates were observed on May 12 (MJD 56059), and 0.298 (+0.033, -0.031) c/s/cm2 and 0.330 (+0.035, -0.034) c/s/cm2 in the 2-4 keV and 4-10 keV bands, respectively.

The data were taken with the 60/90 cm Schmidt telescope at Konkoly Observatory, Piszkesteto, Hungary. Aperture photometry on the nova was computed and calibrated via 7 local comparison stars having Tycho-2 photometry. The following magnitudes have been obtained for the nova: B = 8.22 +/- 0.13 mag; V = 7.38 +/- 0.07 mag.

741,ATEL #11588,"Following reports of a new transient of magnitude 6.2 in Perseus on 2018 April 29.4740 UT discovered by Y. Nakamura designated TCP J04432130+4721280 ( ) and positionally coincident with the previously known U Gem type dwarf nova V392 Per, we obtained an optical spectrum on 2018 April 30.116 UT (range: 396-687 nm; resolution 0.3 nm) with the 2.4 m Hiltner telescope (+OSMOS) of the MDM Observatory on Kitt Peak. The spectrum (see the link below) exhibits broad H&alpha; emission and overlapping Fe II emission lines with P Cygni-type line profiles superposed on a flat continuum. The FWHM of H&alpha; emission is about 5200 km/s and its equivalent width is about 11.5 nm. The center of the blue-shifted H&alpha; absorption component is displaced by about -2680 km/s with respect to the fitted center of the emission component and its equivalent width is about 1.6 nm. Sharp interstellar absorption lines of Na I D1 and D2 are present with equivalent widths of about 0.1 nm. Our spectrum is similar to that obtained by R. Leadbeater on April 29.894 UT ( ). The spectrum is reminiscent of classical novae early in their outburst and prior to maximum light so the observed amplitude of ~10 mag might be a lower limit. The observational circumstances of V392 Per are becoming difficult so continued optical photometry and spectroscopy to monitor its evolution are strongly encouraged. We note that the object is sun-constrained to Swift for the next 80 days. We thank C. M. Retter for assistance with the observations. Optical spectrum of V392 Per on 2018 April 30.116 UT:  "

There is no known LAT source within 2 degrees around the nova. Assuming a simple power law spectrum, the photon flux is F(100MeV-300GeV) = (8.9 +/- 2.9) x 10^-7 ph/cm^2/s, with a photon index of 1.9 +/- 0.2 and TS = 40 (equivalent to a ~6 sigma detection).

744,ATEL #11591,"We report on the optical photometric observation of MAXI J1820+070 with the 2.4m telescope at Lijiang Gaomeigu Station of Yunnan observatories with our Fast Optical Camera (FOC) on April 22, 2018, following the detection of low frequency QPO in the optical band (ATEL #11510). Photometry observations of MAXI J1820+070 in white light were performed with FOC on April 22 from UT 20:20 for nearly two hours to investigate short-term variability on sub-second time scales, including the low frequency QPO detected in the optical (ATEL #11510). A total of 200+ thousand images were taken with a frame-time of 22.9 milliseconds in a field of view of 1.5 arcmin x 1.5 arcmin. The variation of the optical flux in the optical counterpart of MAXI J1820+070 was calibrated via four brightest nearby reference stars which were simultaneously detected in the field-of-view. Our preliminary analysis shows the optical low frequency QPO was at around 0.157 +- 0.002 Hz with a FWHM of 0.030 +- 0.006 Hz during our FOC observations, consistent with the primary of the low frequency QPO in frequency seen in the X-ray power spectrum of the Swift XRT observation performed in the same period of time around April 22 20:30 (UT). The average fractional rms of the optical low frequency QPO was about (4.1 +- 0.3)%. Our observation of the low frequency QPO is consistent with the frequency evolution of the X-ray QPO as seen with Swift/XRT observations in the past few weeks (see ATEL #11488, #11578). The optical low frequency QPO shown in the FOC observation on April 22 is the highest in frequency among detections of optical, UV or Infrared low frequency QPOs, which were in the frequency range 0.05-0.13 Hz (Motch et al. 1983; Hynes et al. 2003; Durant et al. 2009; Veledina et al. 2015; Kalamkar et al. 2016; Pahari et al. 2017; Yu et al. 2018 in ATEL #11510). We appreciate the efforts of the Swift PI Brad Cenko and the HXMT PI Shuangnan Zhang for scheduling coordinated observations.

747,ATEL #11584,"The Five hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), operated by the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, has discovered a radio millisecond pulsar (MSP) coincident with the unassociated gamma-ray source 3FGL J0318.1+0252 (Acero et al. 2015 ApJS, 218, 23), also known as FL8Y J0318.2+0254 in the recently released Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) 8-year Point Source List (FL8Y). Following the discovery of the radio pulsar, gamma-ray pulsations were detected in 9.6 years of Fermi-LAT data by performing a semi-blind search around the spin period from the radio discovery, searching over the full FL8Y localization region and over a range of spin-down rates typical for MSPs. The newly detected pulsar is named PSR J0318+0253 based on the refined position from gamma-ray analysis. J0318+0253 has a precise position of RA(J2000)=03:18:15.54, Dec(J2000)=+02:53:01.5, a period of 5.19 milliseconds, a dispersion measure of 26 pc cm^-3 that corresponds to a distance of about 1.3 kpc based on Yao et al. (2016), and no detectable acceleration. Previous radio observations of 3FGL J0318.1+0252, including three different epochs with Arecibo with a typical individual integration times of 15 minutes in June 2013, did not detect the MSP. On 27 Feb. 2018, in a one-hour tracking observation with the FAST ultra-wide band receiver, the radio pulses toward 3FGL J0318.1+0252 were detected with 512 MHz bandwidth centered around 560 MHz. We estimated the pulsar’s flux density to be ~100 micro-Jy, corresponding to less than 15 micro-Jy in L-band assuming a canonical spectral index of 2.1, making this potentially one of the faintest MSPs discovered in the radio band. The detection and timing of gamma-ray pulsations confirms that it is an isolated pulsar. No X-ray counterpart is detected at the pulsar position. An analysis of 3.4 ks of Swift XRT observations of the region resulted in an unabsorbed flux upper limit in the 0.3-10 keV energy range of 2.8e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1, for an assumed power-law spectrum of index 2 and an absorption column N(H) = 8 × 10^20 cm^-2 in the direction of the MSP.

750,ATEL #11583,"As part of our young stellar object (YSO) sub-mm monthly monitoring programme, the JCMT Transient Survey (Herczeg et al. 2017 ApJ, 849, 43; Johnstone et al. 2018 ApJ, 854, 31), we have uncovered a steady sixteen-month decline in the 850 micron peak brightness of YSO HOPS 358 (R.A. 05:46:07.2, Dec. -00:13:30.9) in NGC 2068 (d=388 pc). Our 850 micron sub-mm continuum monitoring of this source with SCUBA2 on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) revealed no evidence of variability during the first nine epochs, December 26, 2015 through November 26, 2016. Over this time the mean peak brightness of the source within the JCMT (15"" beam) was 1.47 +/- 0.03 Jy/bm. The most recent twelve epochs show a steep roughly linear decline in sub-mm brightness through the most recent measurement on March 31, 2018, where the peak brightness was 1.16 +/- 0.04 Jy/bm (see light curve and finder chart at this URL). Thus, HOPS 358 has dimmed in the sub-mm by 25% over sixteen months. While the absolute calibration of the JCMT is typically uncertain by about 10%, the relative calibration of the JCMT Transient Survey between epochs is significantly better, roughly 2% (Mairs et al. 2017 ApJ, 843, 55). The YSO HOPS 358 (Furlan et al. 2016, ApJS, 224, 5) is classified based on Herschel Space Observatory continuum observations as a PACS Bright Red Source (PBRS, Stutz et al. 2013 ApJ, 767, 36). Based on this classification, it is thought to be among the youngest and most deeply embedded YSOs in NGC 2068. HOPS 358 is embedded within the dense core HH25 MMS (Bontemps et al. 1995, A&A, 297, 98) and has a KVN-measured deuterium fractionation no higher than typical protostars (Kang et al. 2015, ApJ, 814,31). At higher angular resolution, using the SMA, HH25 MMS breaks into three sub-mm peaks separated by ~10"", with HOPS 358 associated with the most northern peak SMM1 (Chen et al. 2013, ApJ, 768, 110). The much fainter source HOPS 316, located 6.9"" north of HOPS 358, may contaminate the peak beam. Difference maps between the most recent epochs and the earlier measurements show clearly that the decrease in flux is coincident with the position of HOPS 358.

Observations at various wavelengths, including the optical counterpart ASASSN-18ey (ATel #11400), suggest that the source is a black hole transient in the hard spectral state (e.g., ATel #11418, #11423, #11420, #11426). NICER has been observing the source on a regular basis. Recent NICER observations (April 16-20) reveal variability that remains consistent with a black hole hard state, but with a continuing power-spectral evolution toward higher frequencies. Low-frequency QPOs were previously detected with INTEGRAL (~0.045 Hz on March 27, ATel #11488) and Swift (~0.06 Hz on April 1, ATel #11510). NICER observations on April 16/17 reveal two harmonically related QPOs at 0.125(3) Hz and 0.238(6) Hz. These QPOs have fractional rms amplitudes in the 0.2-12 keV band of 8+/-1% and 4+/-1%, respectively, and Q-values between 3 and 8. Although the frequencies of the low-frequency QPOs continue to increase, this does not necessarily mean that a state transition is imminent. For example, during the 2000 outburst of the black hole transient XTE J1118+480 the low-frequency QPO increased in frequency from 0.07 Hz to 0.15 Hz, without the source ever leaving the hard state (Wood et al. 2000, ApJ, 544, L45). Spectrally, no clear evolution has been seen in the last couple of weeks. A NICER 0.5-10 keV spectrum obtained on April 20 can be modeled well with an absorbed, strongly Comptonized low-temperature accretion disk component (kT~0.28 keV, power-law index ~1.65), confirming that the source remains in the hard state. A broad iron line is present as well at 6.7 keV (EW=140 eV). The unabsorbed (NH~1.2e21) 0.5-10 keV flux is 4.5e-8 erg/cm^2/s. We also obtained a distance measurement for MAXI J1820+070 from the GAIA data archive (Brown et al. 2018; <A> </A>). The parallax of the source is listed as 0.30+/-0.10 mas, indicating a relatively nearby black hole X-ray binary at a distance of ~3.3 (-0.8/+1.7) kpc. Using the flux quoted above, this distance implies a 0.5-10 keV luminosity of 5.7e37 erg/s, which corresponds to ~6% of the Eddington luminosity for a 8 Msun black hole. This number could be substantially higher when taking into account the flux outside the 0.5-10 keV band. Finally, we note that further inspection of NICER observations taken during the rise of the outburst between March 12 and March 16 (unabsorbed flux: ~(0.3-1.5)e-8 erg/cm^2/s), reveals strong dips in the light curves below 2 keV. While spectral analysis suggests that these dips are due to absorption and/or obscuration (possibly ionized), their nature is not yet fully understood. These dips were no longer seen once the source reached its current flux plateau (after March 21). The presence of the dips could indicate that MAXI J1820+070 is viewed at a relatively high inclination (>70 degrees). NICER is a 0.2-12 keV X-ray telescope operating on the International Space Station. The NICER mission and portions of the NICER science team activities are funded by NASA."
752,ATEL #11577,"We report detections of pre-discovery outbursts of SPIRITS17pc, discovered as part of the ongoing Spitzer InfraRed Intensive Transients Survey (SPIRITS) using the 3.6 and 4.5 micron imaging channels ([3.6] and [4.5]) of the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope (ATel #11575). SPIRITS17pc was discovered in Spitzer/IRAC images taken on UT 2017 Oct. 12.8 at [4.5] = 15.02 +- 0.03 mag (Vega). The [3.6] - [4.5] color is 0.52 +- 0.05 mag. Analysis of the pre-discovery light curve, based on image subtraction with archival reference image stacks from 2004-2008, indicates 2 additional, progressively brightening outbursts, peaking at [4.5] = 16.3 +- 0.1 mag and 15.8 +- 0.1 mag at 783 and 551 days before the discovery outburst, respectively. At an RA and Dec of 12:25:44.43, +12:39:44.5, SPIRITS17pc is located 33.2 arcsec from the center of NGC 4388 (z=0.008419, d=18 Mpc, m-M=31.3 mag, from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database; NED), a prominent member of the Virgo Cluster and known Seyfert 2 galaxy. At the distance to the putative host, the absolute magnitude at [4.5] is approximately -16.3 mag, in the luminosity range typically observed for core-collapse SNe at infrared wavelengths. There is no obvious quiescent counterpart detected in the archival Spitzer/IRAC images used as references for subtraction, and due to bright background emission we are unable to place any meaningful limits on the mid-IR luminosity of the progenitor. We also examined the archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of the site, which has optical to near-IR coverage with WFC3 in the F336W, F438W, F814W, F110W, and F160W filters taken on 2017 June 8 as part of the program part of program GO-12185 (PI J. Greene). By registering with a high resolution J-band image of the transient with Keck/NIRC2 taken on 2017 Dec. 8, we determined the precise position of SPIRITS17pc in the HST/WFC3 F110W frame to astrometric rms uncertainty of 0.15 WFC3 pixels (0.02 arcsec). We identify a point-like object consistent with the transient position. We measured photometry for the candidate from the WFC3 data using Dolphot (Dolphin 2000, PASP, 112, 1397) and found F336W = 25.52 +/- 0.22, F438W = 26.23 +/- 0.38, F814W = 24.00 +/- 0.05, F110W = 21.57 +/- 0.03, and F160W = 20.34 +/- 0.02 mag (Vega). Initial modelling of the broadband spectral energy distribution with DUSTY (Ivezic, Nenkova & Elitzur 1999) is consistent with a luminous, hot star with log(L/Lsun) ~ 5.3, T_eff ~ 20,000 K, active dust formation (dust temperature ~ 1800 K), and relatively low foreground host reddening at E(B-V) < 0.54 mag. Continued monitoring in the optical, infrared and radio, and analysis of the progenitor are ongoing."
753,ATEL #11578,"The X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070, discovered through its ongoing outburst beginning on 11th March (ATEL #11399), is likely a black hole binary in the hard state (e.g. ATEL #11418, #11423, #11420, #11426). Several observations have been made with NuSTAR. A low frequency QPO, often with 2:1 and occasionally 3:1 harmonics, is detected in all observations since the outburst peak. The characteristic frequency of the QPO increases exponentially with time, as log<sub>10</sub>(f/Hz) = 0.01869*t - 2.9158 (for time in days from 2018-01-01, MJD 58119), i.e. an e-folding time of 23 days. A plot of the QPO frequencies can be found at the link below. Low frequency QPOs have also been detected with INTEGRAL (ATEL #11488), Swift (ATEL #11510) and NICER (ATEL #11576) at frequencies matching this relation. The QPO seen by NuSTAR is present at all energies from 3-78 keV, implying that the same phenomenon is responsible for all these detections. Despite the large change in QPO frequency, the X-ray flux (as measured by Swift/BAT) is decreasing slowly and any spectral evolution (across 0.3-78 keV, measured by NuSTAR, Swift and NICER) is minimal. The NuSTAR spectrum comprises a hard powerlaw and reflection spectrum (broad iron line and Compton hump), as expected for a corona and accretion disc around a rapidly spinning black hole. NuSTAR results will be presented in full in a future publication (Buisson et al. in prep.). Figure showing evolution of QPO frequency with time:  "
754,ATEL #11579,"We report the detection of a pre-discovery outburst of SPIRITS17qm, discovered as part of the ongoing Spitzer InfraRed Intensive Transients Survey (SPIRITS) using the 3.6 and 4.5 micron imaging channels ([3.6] and [4.5]) of the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope (ATel #11575). SPIRITS17qm was discovered in Spitzer/IRAC images taken on UT 2017 Nov. 5 at [4.5] = 15.44 +\- 0.03 mag (Vega). The [3.6] - [4.5] color is 0.21 +\- 0.04 mag. Analysis of the pre-discovery light curve, based on image subtraction with archival reference images from 2004, indicates a previous infrared outburst peaking at [4.5] = 16.12 +\- 0.06 mag 1322 days before the discovery outburst. At an RA and Dec of 03:33:38.85, -36:08:09.4, SPIRITS17qm is located 33.5 arcsec from the center of NGC 1365 (z=0.005457, d=18 Mpc, m-M=31.3 mag, from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database; NED). At the distance to the putative host, the absolute magnitude at [4.5] is approximately -15.9 mag, in the luminosity range typically observed for core-collapse SNe at infrared wavelengths. In the archival Spitzer/IRAC images used as references for subtraction, the transient is coincident with what appears to be a distinct source blended with a marginally resolved cluster. We also examined the archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of the site, which includes two epochs with WFPC2/F606W taken on 2001 March 08 and 2001 June 09 as part of program SNAP-8597 (PI Regan). By registering with the Spitzer/IRAC [3.6] discovery image, we determined the position of SPIRITS17pc in the 2001 March 08 HST/WFPC2 frame to astrometric rms uncertainty of 3.0 WFPC2 pixels (0.3 arcsec). We identify a point-like object consistent with the transient position. The F606W magnitudes (Vega) for this object from the Hubble Legacy Archive source catalogs are 22.45 (2001-03-08) and 20.77 (2001-06-09). At the assumed distance to the host and correcting for Galactic extinction from NED with A_F606W = 0.49 mag, the absolute magnitudes are -9.3 and -11.0, indicating the source is luminous and highly variable, and thus, likely associated with SPIRITS17qm. Continued monitoring in the optical, IR and radio, and analysis of the progenitor are ongoing."
755,ATEL #11580,"We report Swift observations of the z=1.41 QSO GAIA 18ayp (PKS 2333-415) which was detected by GAIA in an optically flaring state on 2018-April-14. Swift observed GAIA 18ayp on 2018 April 23 for a total of 1.4 ks. The QSO is clearly detected in X-rays and the UV. The X-ray position found using the enhanced XRT position (Goad et al. 2007, Evans et al. 2009) is RA-2000 = 23 36 34.1, Dec-2000 = -41 15 21.4 with an uncertainty of 3.0"". This position coincides with the z=1.41 blazar PKS 2333-415. The X-ray spectrum in the observed 0.3-10 keV band can be fitted with an absorbed power law model with the absorption column density fixed to the Galactic value (1.71e20 cm^-2). The X-ray photon index is Gamma = 1.65+/-0.43. The flux in the observed 0.3-10 keV band is (1.2+/-0.2)e-15 W m^-2. In the UVOT, the QSO was observed in the W1 and M2 filters with 17.65+/-0.10 and 18.27+/-0.07 mag in the Vega system, respectively (not corrected for Galactic extinction). In the 0.1-300 GeV gamma-ray band, the blazar is associated to the Fermi-LAT catalog source 3FGL J2336.5-4116 (Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23). No significant gamma-ray emission positionally consistent with this source was detected by the LAT on the time scales corresponding to the optical and X-ray observations reported above, showing that there is no gamma-ray flaring activity corresponding to the multi-wavelength variability. We derive an upper limit on the gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV) in the time period 14-23 April 2018 of 8.0 x 10^-8 photons cm^-2 s^-1."
756,ATEL #11581,"The accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar Swift J1756.9-2508 has been in outburst since 2018 April 1 (ATel #11497, #11502, #11505, #11523, #11566) and has been subject to regular monitoring with NICER (ATel #11502). Our preliminary results show that the source flux has been decaying since the first NICER observation obtained on 2018 April 3 15:18 UTC. The most recent positive NICER detection of this source was during an observation starting on April 11 01:16 UTC, for 5 ks. At that time, the spectrum was well described (red. chi^2 = 1.09; 468 dof) by an absorbed power-law model with N_H = (4.8 +/- 0.1)e22 cm^(-2) and power-law photon index Gamma=(2.3 +/- 0.1), yielding a 1-10 keV unabsorbed flux of F=(9.5+/-0.4)e-11 erg/s/cm^2. NICERs latest observation was performed on 2018 April 25 20:16 UTC, for a total of 1.5 ks. We found that the 1-10 keV light curve was consistent with background levels. Applying the above model to the April 25 data, we obtain a 95%-confidence upper limit on the 1-10 keV unabsorbed source flux of F=1.9e-11 erg/s/cm^2. (This limit does not account for systematic uncertainties in our background model.) Our upper limit is about 5 times fainter than the previously detected flux. Periodicity searches also find no evidence of pulsed X-ray emission in this observation. The lack of a pulsed detection likely indicates that this transient source has returned to X-ray quiescence. NICER is a 0.2-12 keV X-ray telescope operating on the International Space Station. The NICER mission and portions of the NICER science team activities are funded by NASA."

758,ATEL #11573,"Following our initial report (ATEL #11528), we continued to follow the spectroscopic evolution of PNV J18040967-1803581 (CBET No. 4507), a possible classical nova or stellar merger event. In addition to our first spectrum obtained on 2018 April 10.444 UT and reported on ATEL #11528, we obtained additional optical spectra (range: 396-687 nm; resolution 0.3 nm) on 2018 April 12.466, 15.450, and 22.434 with the 2.4 m Hiltner telescope (+OSMOS) of the MDM Observatory on Kitt Peak. The four epochs are shown from bottom to top in the montage at the link below. The most recent spectra show considerable strengthening of the emission components of H&alpha;, H&beta;, Fe II multiplets of 27, 37, 38, 42, 46, 48, 49, 55, and 74, and Na I D1 and D2. The spectrum is now consistent with that of a slow Fe II-type classical nova during the early decline phase in agreement with that reported by Joshi, Srivastava, and Banerjee (ATEL #11570) based on a near-infrared spectrum obtained on 2018 April 14.96. The optical emission lines still continue to exhibit P Cygni-type line profiles. On April 10, 15, and 22, the center of the blue-shifted absorption component of H&alpha; is displaced by -617, -608 and -780 km/s respectively with respect to the fitted emission component. The FWHM of H&alpha; emission corresponds to 774, 1500, and 1700 km/s respectively on the same dates. The equivalent width of the H&alpha; emission component on April 22 was -44 nm.

759,ATEL #11574,"We report optical monitoring of the black hole candidate X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 (e.g. ATEL #11399, #11418, #11420) using the University of Florida Rosemary Hill Observatory 14-inch telescope. We used a DMK CCD in white light (roughly corresponding to Gaia G-band) to obtain 17 epochs of data with 1.1Hz cadence for several hours per epoch, beginning on 28 March 2018 UT (MJD 58205). In addition to fast variability signatures (see also ATEL #11421, #11423, #11426, #11432, #11437, #11451, #11510), we have analyzed a subset of the data to study the long-timescale optical behavior in the outburst. We analyzed aperture photometry of 10-minute averages of the 1.1Hz data over several nights. We find that the optical flux initially tracked the fading of the X-rays, as seen on long timescales by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), fading slowly from a magnitude of G=11.7 mag on MJD 58205. However, the optical flux appeared to decouple from the X-ray lightcurve over the time period MJD 58221 to 58227 (see figure attached). During this time period, the Swift BAT 15-50 keV X-ray flux decreased smoothly by about 10%, while the optical flux dropped sharply by about 0.35 mag (35%) in G, followed by a sharp increase in flux/variability. This apparent decoupling does not seem to match simple X-ray reprocessing models for producing the dominant optical flux during the outburst. However, the reported fast optical/IR variability (see references above) seems to indicate that the optical flux may arise in the inner regions of a jet, as seen in other sources such as V404 Cyg (Gandhi et al., 2016; Gandhi et al., 2017; Dallilar et al., 2017). The jet scenario would also be consistent with the decoupling of the X-ray/optical fluxes we observe. If this is the case, the relatively fast fading and instability in the optical flux may indicate that the jet in MAXI J1820+070 is weakening and/or becoming unstable, while the X-ray flux continues to slowly and smoothly fade on long timescales. ATEL #11539 report fading of the radio flux (which may also have a jet origin), which seems to roughly correlate with the Swift/BAT X-ray fading. However, in systems such as V404 Cyg in its 2015 outburst, the radio flux was seen to probe a much larger, steadier region of the jet as compared to the optical/IR flux arising from the inner jet (i.e. Dallilar et al., 2017). The authors thank T. Maccarone for pointing out to us how very bright this source had become, and the University of Florida for its support of the Rosemary Hill Observatory.

761,ATEL #11568,"Recent MAXI/GSC observations revealed unexpectedly rapid decay of the X-ray flux of the black hole candidate MAXI J1535-571 discovered on 2017 September 2, MJD 57998 (ATel #10699, #10700). The source has been in the soft (thermal dominated) state since the end of the last November, around MJD 58100 (ATel #11020). On MJD 58120-58130, the X-ray flux increased by a factor of about two with the spectrum unchanged, but afterward the flux continued to decrease almost exponentially (Nakahira et al. PASJ, submitted, arXiv:1804.00800). Recent MAXI/GSC data show that the flux decreased rapidly after MJD 58190-58200, and that the 2-10 keV flux has been below the detection limit of GSC for 4days (about 8 mCrab) since April 16, MJD 58224, when the flux was lower than the extrapolation of the exponential decay by one order of magnitude. The spectrum tended to soften with the decrease, and no soft-to-hard transition was recognized. From previous outburst study of X-ray novae, the soft-to-hard transition is known to occur at 1-4% of the Eddington luminosity (Maccarone 2003, A&A, 409, 697), and such a transition was expected to occur until the end of March even if the observed peak flux corresponded to the Eddington luminosity. Rapid decrease at the end of an outburst after the soft-to-hard transition was often observed. This time, however, the source faded away remaining in the soft state, suggesting that for instance the disk evaporation triggering the hard state (e.g., Meyer et al. 2000, A&A, 361, 175) did not work even in low mass accretion rates. We encourage multi-wavelength observations to understand what happens and know the current status of the accretion disk of the rare bright black hole X-ray nova. MAXI data for MAXI J1535-571:  "

763,ATEL #11570,"We report near-infrared IJHKs photometric and spectroscopic (0.85 to 2.35 micron region, R ~ 1000) observations of nova PNV J18040967-1803581. Observations were made on UT 2018 April 14.96 using the Near IR camera/spectrograph (NICS) deployed on the 1.2m Mount Abu observatory telescope. Our spectrum distinctly shows various Hydrogen lines of Balmer and Paschen series, O I lines e.g. 1.1287, 1.3164 micron and N I e.g. 1.2461/1.2469 micron. He I 1.0830 micron is present but weak in strength. Emission lines are showing extremely weak P Cyg profile unlike previous optical spectrum(ATel #11528). Presence of strong neutral Carbon lines e.g. 1.0693, 1.1330, 1.6005, 1.6890, 1.9722, 2.1023, 2.2906 micron clearly confirms that the nova is of FeII class (Banerjee and Ashok, 2012, BASI, 40, 243). FWHM of Paschen Beta emission line corresponds to ~1500 km/s. We have also clearly detected several low excitation lines of Na I e.g. 2.2056, 2.2084 micron and Mg I 1.504, 1.7109 micron in emission. These lines form from elements of low ionization potential (~5 to 7 eV) relative to that of H, O or N (~13 to 14 eV) and are good indicators of potential dust formation as they imply the presence of a cool zone (Das et al., 2008, MNRAS, 391, 1874). Dust has always formed in a nova when these lines were seen in its NIR spectrum. We, thus, expect Nova PNV J18040967-1803581 to form dust. NIR photometry gives following magnitudes: J = 5.81+-0.15, H=5.12+-0.15 and Ks=4.61+-0.2."

768,ATEL #11566,"Following the reports of a new outburst of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar Swift J1756.9-2508 (ATel #11497, #11502, #11505, #11523), we performed ToO observations of this source with Astrosat for 21.4 ks on April 10, 2018 between 14:27:48 UTC and 15:41:39 UTC. We here report the detection of this latest outburst of this source simultaneously with Astrosat LAXPC and SXT providing a broadband coverage. A source is detected significantly using both LAXPC and SXT over a wideband range of 0.7-25 keV. The position was consistent with that reported by NICER and INTEGRAL. We fitted the combined spectrum with an absorbed multi-colored blackbody and a powerlaw (tbabs*(diskbb+powerlaw) in Xspec). We performed a joint fit using LAXPC and SXT, and the neutral hydrogen column density, the disk temperature and the powerlaw index were tied for the spectral fit of the two instruments. We found the neutral hydrogen column density to be 4.29(8)E22 cm^(-2) which is slightly lower than the value obtained from the NICER observation. The value of the inner disk temperature and the powerlaw index were obtained to be 1.71(+/-0.02) keV and 2.31(+/-0.08) respectively. For the SXT spectrum, the powerlaw component was not needed and hence the normalization was kept frozen to zero. The total 1-25 keV unabsorbed flux is 7.47E-10 erg/s/cm^(-2). No evidence of any broad spectral line was present in the data (Patruno et al 2010). The power spectra constructed from the high time resolution LAXPC data were searched and no detection of any significant presence of the accretion powered millisecond pulsations as reported in ATel #11502 could be obtained in the preliminary analysis. Further multi-wavelength observations of this recent outburst of the source are encouraged. We are grateful to the Astrosat team for the rapid scheduling of this ToO observation."

770,ATEL #11559,"Binary, Cataclysmic Variable, Variables The symbiotic system AG Dra regularly undergoes quiescent and active stages which consist of several outbursts repeating at about 360d interval (Galis et al. 2017, OEJV 180, 24). After seven years of flat quiescence following the 2006-08 major outbursts, in the late spring of 2015, AG Dra began rising again in brightness toward what appeared to be a new minor outburst (ATel #7582). The recent outburst activity of AG Dra was definitely confirmed by the outbursts in April 2016 and May 2017 (ATel #8975; ATel #10390). The maximal magnitudes (10.7, 9.9 and 10.7 in B filter) rank all these brightenings to the minor outbursts of symbiotic binary AG Dra. Such photometric behavior of the active stage is very unusual. More often, the activity of AG Dra starts with a major outburst, during which the brightness can reach the 8.8 and 8.4 mag in B and V band, respectively. Recent outburst activity resembles the weak activity stage 1963-66 (Hric et al. 2014, MNRAS 443, 1103). UV and X-ray observations showed that there are two types of outbursts: cool and hot ones (Gonzalez-Riestra et al. 1999, A&A 347, 478). Leedjarv et al. (2016, MNRAS 456, 2558) demonstrated that the outbursts of AG Dra can be clearly distinguished also according to the behavior of the prominent emission lines in optical spectra. High-dispersion spectroscopy confirmed significant increase of equivalent widths (EWs) of the emission lines Hbeta, He II (4686), Halpha, He I (6678), and Raman-scattered O VI (6825) during all three recent outbursts of AG Dra. At the same times, the blue-wing absorption component observed in the profiles of the emission lines He I (6678), H alpha and H beta completely disappeared and HeII/Hbeta flux ratio was higher than 1. Such spectroscopic behavior is typical for the hot outbursts of AG Dra (Munari et a. 2009, PASP 121, 1070; Leedjarv et al. 2016, MNRAS 456, 2558). Here, we report about the onset of a new outburst, the fourth one during the present active stage of AG Dra. After sharp and short-lasting hot outburst in May 2017 during which magnitudes of AG Dra reached U=10.29, B=10.723, V=9.528, Rc=8.728, and I=8.148 on May 16, 2017 (JD 2457890.439; ATel #10390), the symbiotic binary returned to brightness typical for its quiescence stages (April 2, 2018, JD 2458211.360; U=11.07, B=11.01, V=9.68, Rc=8.80, Ic=8.15, +/- 0.05 in U, 0.03 in B and 0.02 in VRI). Since then, AG Dra has begun a rise in brightness, reaching U=10.82, B=10.95, V=9.67, Rc=8.77, and I=8.13 on April 14, 2018 (JD 2458223.300) and B=10.57, V=9.45, on April 20, 2018 (JD 2458229.329). As part of ARAS spectroscopic monitoring (link to database below), a mid-resolution spectrum of AG Dra (resolving power 13000, range 4000-7950 Ang) has been obtained with the 31cm telescope on Mill Ridge Observatory, Canada on February 26, 2018 (JD 2458175.883). The ratio HeII/Hbeta was 0.67, EWs were 18.91, 28.11, 97.19, 2.03 and 7.37 Ang for He II (4686), Hbeta, Halpha, He I (6678) and O VI (6825), respectively. For reference, values typical for quiescence of AG Dra are HeII/Hbeta = 0.70, EWs He II 16.5, Hbeta 22.2, Halpha 81.0, He I 1.5 and O VI 6.3 Ang. Low-resolution spectra of AG Dra obtained on April 15, 2018 (JD 2458223.734) and April 18, 2018 (JD 2458227.388) suggested an increase in the ratio of He II/Hbeta. A mid-resolution Echelle spectrum of AG Dra (resolving power 11000, range 4200-7400 Ang) has been obtained on April 20, 2018 (JD 2458229.363) with the 35cm telescope with eShel spectrograph in Rouen, France. The values of the HeII/Hbeta ratio (1.16), as well as EWs of prominent emission lines (He II 37.21, Hbeta 32.20, Halpha 87.97, He I 1.94, O VI 8.72 Ang), confirm that the fourth hot outburst in the present active stage of symbiotic binary AG Dra is in onset.

Xu and X. Gao (see <a href="" "">TNS</a>), and independently discovered by K. Hornoch et al. in ATel #11527. We obtained a spectrum on 2018 April 13.864 UT using the Russian BTA telescope equipped with the SCORPIO spectrograph. The spectrum was taken with a resolution of 13 &Aring; in the 3670 - 7720 &Aring; range. The candidate shows strong and broad Balmer absorption lines together with many Fe II absorption lines, as well as Mg II, Na I, Si II, Al II. The H&beta; and H&alpha; lines show weak emission components in a P-Cygni profile. The radial velocities in these lines correspond to the M81 galaxy. The blue edge in the absorption lines (H&delta;, H&gamma;, H&beta;, H&alpha;) have velocities 2000 &plusmn; 100 km/s; in the blue edge of Fe II lines (4922, 5018, 5169 &Aring;) we measure velocities of 1800 &plusmn; 100 km/s. We also obtained a spectrum using the SPRAT spectrograph (<a href="" "">Piascik et al. 2014</a>) on the 2-m Liverpool Telescope (LT) on 2018 Apr 17.89 UT. The spectrum had evolved to show strong H&alpha; emission, and we measure the FWHM of the H&alpha; line to be ~1600 km/s. We also detect H&beta; and H&gamma; emission, along with emission lines corresponding to the 5018 and 5169 &Aring; lines of the Fe II 42 multiplet.

The source was also observed with the XRT instrument on-board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory from 2018/01/26 to 2018/04/08 (MJD 58144-58216) with 7 visits almost contemporaneous to the MAGIC observations. The preliminary analysis performed with the publicly available tools ( ) shows a hint of flux variability from a minimum count rate of 0.43 (MJD 58164) to a maximum of 0.62 cnt/s during the last observation (MJD 58216), in the 0.3-10 keV range. MAGIC and Swift/XRT observations of PGC 2402248 will continue during the next days and multiwavelength observations are encouraged. The MAGIC contact persons for these observations are R. Mirzoyan (Razmik.Mirzoyan@mpp.mpg.de), L. Foffano (luca.foffano@phd.unipd.it) and J. Becerra Gonzalez (jbecerra@iac.es).

The preliminary analysis of MAGIC data (1h) taken during the night between 2018/04/17 and 2018/04/18 (MJD 58225-58226) yields a detection with a statistical significance of more than 9 standard deviations, and indicates an integral flux of (1.2 +/- 0.2)e-10 cm^-2 s-1 above 100 GeV. The estimated flux corresponds to 25% of the Crab Nebula integral flux above the same energy threshold (100 GeV). 3C 279 is a FSRQ located at redshift 0.5362 (Marziani et al. 1996, ApJS, 104, 37) which was first detected as a VHE emitter in 2006 (MAGIC collaboration et al. 2008, Science, 320, 1752).

Preliminary analysis indicates that over the past five days, the source was detected with 1-day (E >100 MeV) fluxes of 2 x 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (photon index fixed at 2.2), and a peak of (3.6 +/- 0.3) x 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainties only) on April 14. Six HE photons (E >10 GeV) are positionally consistent with the source, with the highest-energy photon at 37 GeV. We encourage multiwavelength observations. Because Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring of this source will continue. In consideration of the ongoing activity of this source, we encourage multi-wavelength observations. For this source the Fermi LAT contact people are P. Jean (pjean at irap.omp.eu) and C.C.

On March 9th, 2018 (MJD2458186.6696 we found the source with flux values corresponding to J = 14.966 +/- 0.05, H = 13.926 +/- 0.06 and Ks = 13.365 +/- 0.06, while on MJD2458140.8593 the source luminosity corresponded to J = 16.448 +/- 0.07, H = 15.865 +/- 0.02 and Ks = 14.931 + /- 0.05. Hence, the source has brightened by a factor of 8 in this rather short lapse, this implies that it is undergoing a new major NIR flare.

788,ATEL #11538,"Since 2015 August, the nearby TeV-detected HBL source 1ES 1959+650 (z=0.048) is showing a phase of considerably enhanced X-ray flaring activity compared to the previous years (Kapanadze et al. ""A recent strong X-ray flaring activity of 1ES 1959+650 with possibly less efficient stochastic acceleration"", MNRAS, 461, L26; Kapanadze et al. 2017, ""The second strong X-ray flare in 1ES 1959+650"", MNRAS, 473, 2542; ATel #9949, # 9694, #9205, # 9121, #8468, # 8342, # 8289, #8014, #10439, #10622). Note the flares detected in this epoch are revealed mostly by means of our Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations with X-Ray Telescope (XRT) onboard Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The last Swift-XRT observation of 1ES 1959+650 was performed on 2017 April 15 which revealed the source in a strong flaring state: the 0.3-10 count rate showed an increase by 8% between two different segments of ObsID 00094153001 (separated by 0.8 day from each other). It reached the value of 20.5+/-0.17 cts/s which is by a factor of 2 higher than the weighted mean rate from all XRT observations of our target during 2005--2018. Currently, 1ES 1959+650 is the second brightest blazar in the 0.3-10 KeV energy range (after Mrk 421; see  ). In the framework of one-zone SSC models, a flaring activity of 1ES 1959+650 is also expected in the UV-radio and gamma-ray parts of the spectrum, and intensive multiwavelength observations of 1ES 1959+650 are strongly encouraged to study instable processes and emission mechanisms in this source. XRT is one of the Swift instruments along with Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) and UV/Optical Telescope (UVOT). It is a JET-X Wolter I type telescope, developed jointly by Pennsylvania State University, Brera Astronomical Observatory (OAB) and University of Leicester. Thanks to the unique characteristics, good photon statistics and low background counts of this instrument (in combination with EEV CCD2 detector), we can investigate a flux variability on different time-scales from minutes to years, obtain high-quality spectra for the majority of the observations, derive different spectral parameters, and study their timing behaviour in the 0.3-10 keV range of the electromagnetic spectrum.

This blazar has a redshift of z=0.5362 (Marziani et al. 1996, ApJS, 104, 37). It is one of only seven FSRQs known to be VHE gamma-ray emitters. Preliminary analysis indicates that the source flux has been increasing in the past few days reaching a high state on April 16 with an average gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (10.5+/-0.3) x 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1, a factor of almost 25 greater than the average value reported in the 3FGL. The corresponding average gamma-ray spectrum had a photon index (E>100 MeV) of 2.06+/-0.02. Seven HE photons (E>10Gev) are positionally consistent with it. In particular, during 18:00-24:00 UTC the average flux was (12.0+/-0.7) x 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty only).

The very slow decay of the flaring radio flux is not typical for microquasars such as GRS1915+105 or Cyg X-3, rather it reminds a persistent light curve of Cyg X-1 (ATel #10459) although MAXI J1820+070 stays yet in a flare in X-rays and optical bands.

800,ATEL #11533,"Black Hole, Transient MAXI J1820+070 (ASASSN-18ey) is a black hole candidate X-ray binary (e.g. ATel #11399, #11418, #11420). It is currently in a bright, hard spectral state (ATel #11423, #11427, #11439). Here, we report photometric mid-IR (5-12 &mu;m) observations of the source with the VLT Imager and Spectrometer for the mid-InfraRed (VISIR; Lagage et al. 2004, The Messenger, 117, 12</a>) mounted on UT3 of ESO's Very Large Telescope. The observations were made on 2018 April 8 (07:21-08:08 UTC) and April 9 (08:54-09:41 UTC) in clear conditions (MJD 58216-7). We also report on contemporaneous radio and optical data. MAXI J1820+070 is clearly detected (S/N > 200) in all four mid-IR filters. The following preliminary observed flux densities (F_&nu;) were calculated using observations of standard stars taken on the same nights: Filter - Wavelength(&mu;m) - F_&nu;(mJy; Apr 8) - F_&nu;(mJy; Apr 9) B11.7 - 11.52 - 376 - 378 B10.7 - 10.65 - 353 - 368 J8.9 - 8.72 - 303 - 297 M-band - 4.85 - 292 - 271 Photometric errors are small but systematic errors are up to ~5-15% due to the limited number of available standard stars. These mid-IR flux densities are amongst the brightest reported in a transient low-mass X-ray binary. The Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA) observed MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11420) on 2018 April 8 (06:43-10:46 UTC) at 15.5 GHz. We reduced the data using the reduce_dc pipeline. We then performed cleaning (with natural weighting) and additional flagging in CASA. Using IMFIT in CASA, we measured a flux density of the unresolved point source of 42 +- 2 mJy. The <a href="" "">Al Sadeem Observatory</a> (Owner/Co-founder Thabet Al Qaissieh, Director/Co-founder Alejandro Palado, Resident Astronomer Aldrin B. Gabuya) is located in Al Wathba South, outside the city of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. We observed MAXI J1820+070 on 2018 April 7 (22:21-22:34 UTC) with the Meade LX850 16-inch (41-cm) telescope with an SBIG STT-8300 camera. 20 images (each 30 sec.) were taken in the 'green' Baader LRGB CCD-Filter (similar bandpass to Johnson V-band). The images were bias/dark-subtracted and flat fielded. We measured a brightness of V = 12.05 +- 0.04 mag, calibrated using several APASS stars in the field. From our Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) optical monitoring (ATel #11418) we measure magnitudes (using PanStarrs calibration) of g' = 12.09 +- 0.02, r' = 12.14 +- 0.03, i' = 12.09 +- 0.04, y = 12.08 +- 0.16 on 2018 April 8 (~7 UTC). We de-reddened the above flux densities using an extinction of E(B-V)=0.163 (ATel #11418), and constructed the broadband, radio to optical spectral energy distribution (SED; figure linked below). For comparison, we also include a radio, near-IR and optical SED from 2018 March 18 (data from ATel #11439, #11458 and LCO). The mid-IR fluxes clearly represent an excess over the optical emission, and appear to lie close to the extrapolation of the near-IR excess previously reported in ATel #11458. The SED is similar to those of GX 339-4 (Gandhi et al. 2011, ApJ, 740, L13</a>) and MAXI J1836-194 (Russell et al. 2014, MNRAS, 439, 1390) in which the IR was shown to be produced by synchrotron emission from the jet. The SED shape suggests that the jet break between optically thin and partially self-absorbed synchrotron may reside within the mid-IR to far-IR range. Assuming a simple power law, the radio to mid-IR spectral index is &alpha; ~ +0.3 (where F_&nu; &prop; &nu;^&alpha;). By fitting the April 8 VISIR data and y-band point, we obtain &alpha; ~ -0.7. We encourage coordinated observations during the outburst decay to track the evolution of this spectrum.

803,ATEL #11528,"Recently, T. Kojima and H. Nishimura independently discovered a new optical transient on 2018 April 8.72 - 8.73 UT in Sagittarius with a magnitude of about 11.2. The object was subsequently designated PNV J18040967-1803581 on the CBAT Transient Object Confirmation Page (TOCP;  ). On 2018 April 9.4477 UT the transient was observed by G. Masa and M. Schwartz using the 0.4 m robotic telescope of Tenagra Observatories where the source had R = 9.5 mag. A low resolution (~400) spectrum was obtained by H. Akazawa using a 0.35 m telescope on 2018 April 09.827 UT and showed a H&alpha; emission line with a P-Cyg type line profile. Measurements of the spectrum by K. Ayani and reported on the TOCP showed that the bottom of the blue-shifted absorption line was displaced by about -1100 km/s with respect to the emission peak. We obtained a spectrum (range: 394-687 nm; resolution 0.3 nm) of PNV J18040967-1803581 on 2018 April 10.444 UT with the 2.4 m Hiltner telescope (+OSMOS) of the MDM Observatory on Kitt Peak. The spectrum exhibits emission lines with sharp P Cyg type line profiles superposed on a very red continuum. In agreement with Akazawa and Ayani, the strongest emission line in our spectrum arises from H&alpha;. A simple two-Gaussian deconvolution of the line profile gives a FHWM for the emission component of 774 km/s and an equivalent width of -0.37 nm. The FWHM corresponds to an average expansion velocity of 387 km/s. The absorption component is narrow but quite deep with an equivalent width of 0.98 nm and a FWHM of 632 km/s. In our spectrum, the bottom of the blue-shifted absorption component is displaced by -617 km/s relative to the fitted emission peak. The terminal velocity is about 1400 km/s. The rest of the spectrum is dominated by very weak emission lines with sharp P Cyg type line profiles of H&beta;, H&gamma;, H&delta;, and numerous Fe II lines arising from multiplets 27, 37, 38, 42, 48, 49, 55, and 74. No broad absorption lines arising from a late-type secondary star are apparent in our spectrum at this time. The interstellar Na I D1 and D2 lines are strong with equivalent widths of 0.092 and 0.120 nm respectively, and when combined with the red continuum, suggests that the interstellar absorption is high along the line of sight. Our spectrum does not appear to resemble that of a Fe II classical nova early in the outburst. However, if the possible progenitor from Pan-STARRS DR1 reported by P. Schmeer on the TOCP is related to the transient, then the outburst amplitude is about 12 mag and is comparable to some classical novae. However, the low expansion velocities and the numerous sharp absorption lines suggest that this object may be related to the class of luminous red novae such as V4332 Sgr and V838 Mon. Additional photometry and spectroscopy over the next few weeks may well reveal the nature of PNV J18040967-1803581 so continued observations are encouraged. MDM spectrum of PNV J18040967-1803581:  "

809,ATEL #11517,"Swift J0243.6+6124 is a Be/X-ray transient that was discovered in October 2017 when it started a giant, type-II outburst (Atel #10809, Atel #10822). After reaching the peak around November 5<sup>th</sup> 2017, the source luminosity started to decay slowly over &sim;135 days, although the decay rate increased significantly around two weeks ago. To investigate how exactly the source would decay and potentially transit back into quiescence, we triggered a monitoring program (PI: Degenaar) on the system using the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory (Swift). During the observations the count rate, as observed using the X-ray telescope (XRT), decreased from 2.35&plusmn;0.11 counts/s on March 22<sup>nd</sup> 2018 to 0.60&plusmn;0.03 counts/s on April 1<sup>st</sup> 2018. In this observation, when the source had the lowest observed XRT count rate (April 1<sup>st</sup> 2018), the Swift/XRT spectrum is well fitted by a power-law model (nH=1.6&plusmn;0.3e22 cm<sup>-2</sup> and &Gamma;=0.85&plusmn;0.15), which gives a 0.5-10.0 keV unabsorbed X-ray flux of 5.75&plusmn;0.29e-11 erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup>.

A similar increase in brightness can be seen from the Swift/BAT light curve of the source available at <a href="" ""> </a>.

This outburst reached a peak 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity of 9E35 (D/8 kpc)<sup>2</sup> erg s<sup>-1</sup> on 23 March 2018 (Atel #11487), after which it started to decay in X-rays. On 4 April 2018, the source was no longer detected in a 645 second monitoring observation using the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT). Here, we report the X-ray re-brightening of IGR J17379-3747 in the latest XRT monitoring observation taken on 8 April 2018 00:59 UT. We extract the PC-mode spectrum using the Swift XRT online pipeline (Evans et al. 2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177) and fit it in the 0.5 to 10 keV energy range with an absorbed power law model (TBABS*PO in XSPEC). The spectrum is well-described with an N<sub>H</sub> = (1.05 +/- 0.17) E22 cm<sup>-2</sup>, a power law index 2.6 +/- 0.2 and a reduced chi-squared of 222/351. The unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV and 2-10 keV X-ray fluxes are (4.3 +/- 0.3)E-11 erg s<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> and (1.4 +/- 0.2)E-11 erg s<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. These fluxes correspond to X-ray luminosities of (3.3 +/- 0.2) (D/8 kpc)<sup>2</sup> E35 erg s<sup>-1</sup> and (1.1 +/- 0.1) (D/8 kpc)<sup>2</sup> E35 erg s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Further Swift XRT monitoring observations are planned every other day. Optical observations are planned with Las Cumbres Observatory and VLA radio monitoring is ongoing (Atel #11487). Further multi-wavelength observations are encouraged."

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion, ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients), and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin of the transient.

813,ATEL #11518,"ASASSN-18gq was reported as a low-luminosity transient in the direction of the nearby galaxy ESO325-G011 on April 03 2018 (ATel#11500). The transient was detected as a g=16.5 source on 2018 April 1.89 and was not present during the earlier observations of the field carried out on 2018 March 28.27 (detection limit of g~17.6). Blue UV-optical colors reported by ATel#11501 constrained the nature of the transient as broadly consistent with a young core-collapse supernova. Furthermore the transient was observed by the ePESSTO survey and the spectrum revealed Balmer lines in absorption at zero redshift, contradicting the supernova classification (ATel#11509). We observed the transient with the 2.5m NOT telescope at the ORM observatory during the night of April 03/04 2018 at ~02:00 UT, close to transit of the field at El~19 degrees and AM~3. Our goal is to better constrain the nature of the transient, carrying out a search of the possible progenitor. Astrometry of the field was carried out, utilizing the IRAF imtools.imcoords suite. It was based on 8 individual dithered frames, using between 3 and 7 reference stars in the field, coming from the Sky Mapper Southern Sky Survey DR 1.1. (Wolf et al. 2018, PASA, arXiv:1801.07834). We measure the following mean position: RA= 13:45:03.495+/-0.003 Dec= -41:52:23.34+/-0.23 The reported uncertainties are the statistical errors of the mean. We also note that in general there is a 0.16 arcsec median offset between the Sky Mapper and Gaia astrometry (Wolf et al. 2018). Our position is coinciding within the uncertainties with the position reported by ATel#11500. A comprehensive search in various databases and archives revealed no counterpart around the reported position even with a generously relaxed search radius of 2 arcsec. In particular the non-detection in the Sky Mapper Southern Sky Survey DR1.1 implies progenitor magnitudes higher than ~18 for the entire filter system of the survey. Based on the Gaia DR1 magnitude histogram at   we can conclude that the progenitor should be fainter than G~24. A search in the Hubble Source Catalog (HSCv2), revealed a single counterpart at about 1.5 arcsec from the transient position with a W2_814W=23.5m. The reported limits set up an amplitude of the outburst of the order of 8 magnitudes. Based on the data available, we propose the hypothesis that ASASSN-18gq is a Luminous Red Nova outburst in the direction of ESO325-G011. Further observations are strongly encouraged.

The satellite BRITE-Toronto began monitoring HD 92063 on 15 Feb 2018 (2018-02-15) and captured the rise of light of ASASSN-18fv on 18 March 2018 (2018-03-18); its photometry pre-dates the discovery announcement. BRITE observations of this target are scheduled to continue until 31 July 2018 (2018-07-31). The light curve consists of 4-sec exposures through a custom red filter (550-700 nm) and obtained 3 times per minute during a 15-min portion of each 100-min orbit of the BRITE-Toronto satellite, resulting in about 600 measurements per day. The detector scale of the instrument is about 27 arcsec/pixel and the PSF shape is round and measures about 11 pixels (FWHM) at the field location of HD 92063. As a result, the PSFs of HD 92063 and ASASSN-18fv significantly overlap in the BRITE-Toronto images. BRITE photometry reveals a discernible variation due to ASASSN-18fv starting on 2018-03-18.2 .

822,ATEL #11510,"We report the V-band photometric observation of MAXI J1820+070 (also named ASASSN-18ey, see ATELs #11399, #11400, #11403, #11404, #11406, #11418, #11420, #11421, #11423, #11424, #11425, #11426, #11432, #11437, #11439, #11440, #11445, #11451, #11478, #11481) with the Lijiang 2.4m telescope (+YFOSC) at Lijiang Gaomeigu Station of Yunnan observatories, in comparison with the Swift/XRT observation of MAXI J1820+070 on the same day. Optical photometry observations of the source were performed on March 30th, April 1st, and April 4th. The optical observation from UT 19:53:35 to 20:19:45 on April 1st 2018 is the only observation among three with enough exposure and short frame time to investigate variability on time scales of seconds or longer. The exposure time of each image was set to 3 seconds, and the readout time of each image was about 3.5 second. A total of 240 images were obtained during the observation of about 1570 seconds. The average time resolution is then around 6.5-6.6 seconds. The variation of the V-band optical flux of this transient was measured via 12 local reference stars. The optical light curve shows variability as compared with the reference stars. An average Fourier power spectrum was generated in segments of 64 images each. We found a quasi-periodic oscillation at around 49.53 +-0.5 mHz with a FWHM of 4.6 +- 1.9 mHz (the power spectrum was modeled as a Lorentzian or a zero-centered Lorentzian plus a Lorentzian - we obtained similar results). The average fractional rms is about 3.2% with a significance of around 4.7 sigma. An investigation of the individual power spectra suggested that the signal persisted in most of the segments. The mHz optical QPO might be different from those reported in ATEL #11426, due to its lower fractional amplitude and shorter period, but consistent with the evolution of the X-ray QPO as seen with Swift/XRT observations in the past few weeks. It is interesting to compare optical variability to its X-ray variability, as suggested by ATEL #11432. There was a Swift/XRT observation taken at 09:35:04 on April 1st, 2018 (ObsID 00010627021), which is close the our optical observation on the same day. The XRT was used in the Windowed-Timing mode with exposure time 932.34 seconds. We generated an average Fourier power spectrum from the event mode data. The average X-ray power spectrum was modeled with two zero-centered Lorentzians plus a QPO at 58.04 +- 3.97 mHz with a FWHM of 35.32 +- 15.66 mHz. The fractional rms amplitude was around 13%. The X-ray QPO is likely the low frequency C-type QPO seen in the rising phase of black hole transient outburst, although we still need more data to confirm its origin with more monitoring towards possible spectral transition. The optical QPO we found is at a frequency remarkably close to the X-ray QPOs seen in the Swift/XRT observation within a day, and we suspect that they are related, as inferred from the previous report of correlated optical/X-ray variability. Black hole low frequency QPO has been proposed as originated from the Lense-Thirring precession of the innermost accretion flow (see Ingram, Done & Fragile 2009, 397, L101). However, the smaller FWHM of the optical QPO as compared with that of the X-ray QPO raises questions about whether and how the two are related. The higher coherence of the optical QPO hints itself is not a reprocessed signal as compared with the X-ray QPO. Simultaneous multi-wavelength timing observations are therefore highly encouraged. We would like to thank the Swift team and other colleagues for providing continuous Swift monitoring observations of MAXI J1820+070 to the public."

In the BAT 15-50 keV energy band, the outburst began on 29 March 2018 (MJD 58206) and peaked on 1 April 2018, when the flux reached 0.013 +/- 0.002 ct s-1 cm-2 or ~60 mCrab. The outburst began to decline by 3 April 2018, reaching 0.005 +/- 0.003 ct s-1 cm-2 (~23 mCrab) by 5 April 2018. The peak rate and duration (assuming that the outburst is indeed in its final decline) are comparable to the peak rates and durations the outbursts of 2007 (Krimm et al, 2007, ApJ,688,147) and 2009 (Patruno et al., ATel #2130).

826,ATEL #11506,"We obtained a near-infrared spectrum (range 0.8-1.7 micron, R~3500) of the bright Galactic transient ASASSN-18fv (ATel #11454, #11456, #11460, #11467, #11468, #11504) on UT 2018 April 1.23 with the ARCoIRIS spectrograph mounted on the Blanco 4m telescope at Cerro Tololo in Chile. The spectrum shows a rich set of emission lines over a relatively flat continuum. We identify lines from H I, He I, Ca II, N I, O I, C I transitions with FWHM velocities of a few x 100 km/s to ~2000 km/s. The spectrum does not show any strong absorption lines or P-Cygni profiles, showing significant evolution from the optical spectra obtained ~10 days earlier (ATel #11456, #11460, #11468). The spectrum of ASASSN-18fv is consistent with the observed near-IR spectra of normal Fe II and transition (Fe II + He/N) class novae after peak (e.g., Srivastava et al. 2016, MNRAS, 462, 2074), and significantly different from the near-IR spectra of V838 Mon (Rushton et al. 2005, MNRAS, 360, 1281) and Sakurai's object (e.g., Eyres et al. 1998, MNRAS, 298, 37; Tyne et al. 2000, MNRAS, 315, 595).

827,ATEL #11507,"Following a 2018 March 19 MAXI alert of a new outburst of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary IGR J17379-3747 (ATel #11447), NICER has observed the source daily since 2018 March 29. From that date onward, the mean count rates detected each day through April 1 were 12.9, 11.0, 8.7, and 4.7 ct/s (0.5-12 keV), respectively. The background count rate in this band is less than 1 ct/s. After applying barycenter corrections to the event times using the radio position reported in ATel #11487, we computed a combined power spectrum of the full ~9 ks collected exposure and detected a clear pulsation (> 7 sigma significance for a single trial) at a frequency of 468.05 Hz. The data consist of 11 segments of varying uninterrupted exposure between 500 s and 1000 s duration. We searched these segments for pulsations individually using the PRESTO acceleration search code. We detected a power-spectrum excess near 468.05 Hz in seven of those segments (at a significance ranging from 6 to 8 sigma in each segment, with frequencies ranging from 468.05 to 468.12 Hz). Fitting the observed frequency modulation with a circular orbit model yielded an excellent fit, with an orbital period of 1.88 hrs and a minimum companion mass of 0.055 Msun (assuming a 1.4 Msun neutron star). The barycentric pulsar spin frequency is 468.0832 Hz. We extracted a 0.5-10 keV spectrum for each day, and find they are all consistent with an absorbed power-law model. However, adding a blackbody component significantly improves the fits (reduced Chi^2 = 0.97 for 1278 d.o.f.). The blackbody temperature decreases from 0.52+/-0.06 keV to 0.39+/-0.03 keV as the flux declines. At the same time, the power-law component softens slightly, with the photon index evolving from 2.1+/-0.1 to 2.4+/-0.1. The measured hydrogen column density is N_H=(0.7+/-0.1)e22 cm^-2, consistent with a previously reported value (ATel #1714), but significantly lower than the most recently reported value (ATel #11487). The unabsorbed flux decreases from 7.4e-11 ergs/cm^2/s (2018 March 29) to 2.5e-11 ergs/cm^2/s (2018 April 1). Our pulsation detection conclusively identifies IGR J17379-3747 as an accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar. NICER monitoring of the source continues. Given its rapidly declining X-ray flux, prompt follow up at other wavelengths is encouraged."
828,ATEL #11502,"Following the report of a new outburst of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar Swift J1756.9-2508 (ATel #11497), NICER performed pointed observations starting on 2018 April 3, collecting 9.4 ks of exposure over the ~30 hours between April 3 15:18 UTC and April 4 21:01 UTC. A source is clearly detected at ~30 ct/s (1-10 keV); the background level in this band is less than 1 ct/s. After barycenter-correcting the event times, we computed a power spectrum and detected a >5-sigma pulsation at 182.067 Hz, confirming that the active source is indeed Swift J1756.9-2508 (see Krimm et al. 2007, ApJ 668, L147, and the erratum in Krimm et al. 2009, ApJ 703, L183). The pulsar has a known binary period of 54.7 min. Propagating the best-known orbital solution (Patruno et al. 2010, MNRAS 403, 1426) under the assumption of a constant binary period, we calculated a current-epoch time of ascending node to be T_asc = MJD 58211.0170(2) TDB. The uncertainty on this predicted reference time is less than 0.5% of the orbital period. We then optimized our trial orbital solution by scanning a grid of T_asc values in steps of 1E-5 d. We found the best solution at T_asc = MJD 58211.01736 TDB, consistent with the prediction within 2 sigma (statistical uncertainty). Folding the data using this orbital ephemeris, we retrieved an improved pulsation detection (22 sigma) at frequency F0=182.065803(2) Hz. The pulse profile is non-sinusoidal, showing a fractional sinusoidal amplitude of 5.9% for the fundamental and 3.4% for the first overtone, both measured in the 1-10 keV band. The shape of the pulse profile is similar to those shown in Figure 1 of Patruno et al. (2010), albeit in a somewhat softer, overlapping energy band. A more detailed analysis is underway. The X-ray spectrum is consistent with an absorbed disk-blackbody plus power-law model (red. chi^2 = 1.18 for 840 d.o.f). We measured an absorption column density of N_H = 6.4(2)E22 cm^-2, a disk temperature of kT = 0.17(1) keV, and a power-law photon index of Gamma = 2.04(3). There is no evidence of an Fe line feature near ~6.4 keV in the spectrum. The unabsorbed 1-10 keV flux is 1.3e-9 erg/s/cm^2. All values are consistent with those of the previous outbursts, and suggest that the source is in a typical atoll-type island (hard) spectral state. Further NICER observations of this source are underway. Additional multiwavelength follow-up is encouraged."

During these instances, the source also showed a fast flux and spectral variability down to the sub-hour timescales. Furthermore, 1ES 0033+595 generally showed very hard X-ray spectra with the photon index at 1 keV a=0.93-1.45 and the position of the synchrotron SED peak sometimes moved beyond 10 keV (that occurs very rarely among BL Lacs; see Kapanadze et al. 2016, 831, 102; 2017, ApJ, 848; 103; MNRAS, 469, 1655; MNRAS, 473, 2542). This property is explained in the framework of hadronic models more easily than via the leptonic ones (Sukla et al. 2015, ApJ, 798,2). The last XRT observation performed on 2018 April 1 has evealed a brightening by 36% to 2.50+/-0.08 cts/s in 4 day. The corresponding 0.3-10 keV spectrum shows a good fit with the log-parabolic model (the reduced Chi-squared of 1.04 with 52 degrees-f-freedom; the hydrogen column density fixed to the Galactic value 4.13\times10^{21} from Kalberla er al. 2005, A&A, 440, 775) yielding a=0.99+/-0.24, b=1.06+/-0.31 and the de-absorbed 0.3-10 keV flux of 1.2\times10^{-10} erg/cm^2/s. In the framework of one-zone SSC models, enhanced activity of 1ES 0033+595 is also expected in the UV-radio and gamma-ray parts of the spectrum, and intensive multiwavelength observations of this source are strongly encouraged. XRT is one of the Swift instruments along with Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) and UV/Optical Telescope (UVOT). It is a JET-X Wolter I type telescope, developed jointly by Pennsylvania State University, Brera Astronomical Observatory (OAB) and University of Leicester. Thanks to the unique characteristics, good photon statistics and low background counts of this instrument (in combination with EEV CCD2 detector), we can investigate a flux variability on different time-scales from minutes to years, obtain high-quality spectra for the majority of the observations, derive different spectral parameters, and study their timing behaviour in the 0.3-10 keV range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Swift Satellite is operated by Pennsylvania State University."

839,ATEL #11488,"We report the detection of low-frequency QPOs in the X-ray power spectra of the new X-ray nova and black hole candidate MAXI J1820+070 (ATEL #11399, #11400, #11406, #11418, #11423, #11427). The data were collected during the dedicated ToO observations of the source with INTEGRAL in revolutions 1931-1935 (March 16-27, 2018, ATEL #11478). Since the source is exceptionally bright (>3.5 Crab in the 15-50 keV band) we, willing to avoid systematic effects usual for the IBIS/ISGRI data at high count rates, used NRT data from the SPI telescope in order to perform our timing analysis. We selected the events with energies in the 20-50 keV range and barycentered their times of arrival. All the power spectra show a strong band-limited noise at frequencies below 0.1 Hz. In revolutions 1932-1934 we saw the QPOs with the centroid frequency growing from 0.030+/-0.001 Hz (in rev. 1932) to 0.035+/-0.001 Hz (rev. 1933) and later 0.042+/-0.001 Hz (rev. 1934). Our analysis of the JEM-X monitor X-ray data obtained in rev. 1934 has confirmed the presence of QPOs at 0.04+/-0.01 Hz in the power spectrum of the source but with smaller confidence. Note that the source flux was stable or very slowly increased during this time interval, according to the Swift-BAT transient monitor data (3.6 Crab in the middle of rev. 1932 and 3.8 Crab in the middle of rev. 1934). The similar trend of the flux was found in optical during our photometric and spectroscopic monitoring of the source at the 1.6-m telescope of the Sayan observatory. Note also that the observed shape of the power spectrum, with a broadband noise and a prominent QPO peak, is typical of the low/hard or hard/intermediate states of black hole transients. Follow-up timing observations of the source in X-rays or optical/IR bands are strongly encouraged. We will also continue to monitor the source. Evolution of the QPO frequency in MAX J1820+070:  "

846,ATEL #11487,"IGR J17379-3747 is a neutron star low-mass X-ray binary showing Type I bursts (Chelovekov et al. 2006, AstL, 32, 456; see Chelovekov & Grebenev 2010, AstL, 36, 895 for a correction to the positions reported in the earlier paper). It experienced two outbursts in the past (2004 and 2008; Chelovekov & Grebenev 2010) that did not exceed a peak luminosity of ~1E+36 erg/s, classifying it as a very-faint X-ray transient (Wijnands et al. 2006, A&A, 449, 1117). MAXI/GSC reported renewed X-ray activity of this source on March 19, 2018 (Atel #11447). We subsequently triggered our joint X-ray and radio monitoring campaign with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift) and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We observed IGR J17379-3747 with the VLA on March 22, 2018 from 12:11 to 13:54 UT (MJD 58199.543 +/- 0.035). These observations were taken simultaneously at 4.5 and 7.5 GHz, each with a bandwidth of 1 GHz. The VLA was in its most extended A configuration. 3C286 and J1733-373 were used for primary and secondary calibration, respectively. Following standard procedures, we used the Common Astronomy Software Applications package (CASA v4.7.2; McMullin et al. 2017, ASPC, 376, 127) to calibrate and image the data. We used Briggs weighting with a robustness of zero to balance sensitivity and resolution. We determined the flux density by fitting a point source in the image plane, forcing an elliptical Gaussian fit with the size of the synthesized beam (1.1"" x 0.3"" at 4.5 GHz and 0.69"" x 0.18"" at 7.5 GHz). We measure flux densities of 431 +/- 7 &mu;Jy at 4.5 GHz and 422 +/- 7 &mu;Jy at 7.5 GHz. These measurements provide a spectral index of &alpha; = -0.04 +/- 0.05 (where the flux density S<sub>&nu;</sub> &prop; &nu;<sup>&alpha;</sup>). This spectral index is consistent with a self-absorbed compact jet. The best fit source position (taken at 7.5 GHz) is:</br> RA (J2000) = 17h 37m 58.836s +/- 0.002 s</br> Dec (J2000) = -37d 46' 18.35"" +/- 0.02"",</br> where the errors are calculated using the standard VLA astrometric accuracy of 10% of the synthesized beam. This position is consistent with the enhanced X-ray position measured with the Swift XRT online pipeline (Goad et al. 2007, A&A, 476, 1401) using the two performed monitoring observations of the current outburst (RA: 17h 37m 58.82s, Dec: -37d 46' 18.8"", 90% confidence error radius 2.1""). The Swift XRT monitoring observation closest in time to the radio observation was performed on March 23, 2018 from 13:39 to 13:59 UT. We extract the PC-mode spectrum using the Swift XRT online pipeline (Evans et al. 2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177). The spectrum is well described by an absorbed power law model, yielding an absorption column of N<sub>H</sub> = (1.7 +/- 0.3)E+22 cm<sup>-2</sup> and a power law photon index of 2.12 +/- 0.16. The addition of a soft blackbody component does not significantly improve the fit. The unabsorbed 1-10 keV X-ray flux is (1.76 +/- 0.07)E-10 erg s<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>. Assuming the peak flux during its X-ray bursts (Chelovekov et al. 2006, AstL, 32, 456) reached the empirical Eddington limit for a neutron star (3.8E+38 erg s<sup>-1</sup>; Kuulkers et al. 2003, A&A, 399, 663) places the source at a distance of approximately 8 kpc. For such a distance, the radio and X-ray luminosities are 2.0E+29 erg s<sup>-1</sup> and 1.3E+36 erg s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. At this X-ray luminosity, our radio detection is consistent with the brightest sources in the sample of neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (e.g. Deller et al. 2015, ApJ, 809, 13). Although the radio-brightest neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries include some accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars and transitional millisecond pulsars, we note that other examples of these systems are radio-quieter. Continuing Swift and VLA monitoring of IGR J17379-3747 is planned. Further multiwavelength observations are encouraged."

The moderate flux increase still continues, and the 4-10 keV flux has reached 0.0267 +- 0.0087 ph/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (27 +- 8 mCrab) on 25 March 2018 (MJD 58202). Swift/BAT also observes the on-going outburst. The 15-50 keV flux shows the steady increase, and reached 0.0083 +/- 0.0019 counts/s/cm2 (38 +/- 9 mCrab) on 26 March 2018 (MJD 58203). Before this brightening, Fermi/GBM (Beklen et al. 2009, ATel#2275), Swift/BAT (Krimm et al. 2009, ATel#2276), and MAXI/GSC observed the giant X-ray outburst from this source in 2009. The onset of the previous giant event coincides with the orbital phase of ~0.3. Since there are similarities in the outburst onset phase and the increasing trend, the current outburst might be a giant one since 2009.

849,ATEL #11481,"The detection of the new black hole candidate MAXI J1807+132 has triggered a worldwide follow-up campaign from high energies to radio wavelengths (ATel #11400, #11403, #11418, #11421, #11423, #11424, #11425, #11426, #11427, #11432, #11437, #11439, #11440, #11445, #11451, #11458 and #11458). As part of this observational effort, we have performed spectroscopic observations under our Target of Opportunity programs at both the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and the Very Large Telescope (VLT). These observations are being performed with the OSIRIS (GTC) and X-Shooter (VLT) spectrographs since March 16, 2018. As previously reported (ATels #11424 and #11425), the optical spectrum shows the Bowen blend, hydrogen (Balmer and Paschen series) He-I and He-II emission lines characteristic of low-mass X-ray binaries in outburst. Our preliminary analysis of the data taken over 12 different epochs (March 16 to March 26) reveals a clear evolution in the optical spectra. The March 16 observations show asymmetric Balmer and He-I emission profiles, which are clearly skewed towards the red (see also ATels #11424 and #11425), while more symmetric profiles are observed from March 17 onwards (see linked figure below). This, together with the detection of shallow blue-shifted He-I absorption components in our high signal-to-noise (March 16) X-Shooter spectra, suggest the presence of a wind outflow with a terminal velocity of ~1500 km/s during the early stages of the outburst. A similar phenomenology was observed in the 2015 outbursts of V404 Cyg (Mu&ntilde;oz-Darias et al. 2016, Nature, 534, 75; MNRAS 2017, 465 L124). The brightness of the source, which has gradually increased from g=12.9 on March 16 to g=12.0 on March 26, allowed us to take spectra with time exposures as short as 120s, but only relatively minor variations from spectrum to spectrum are observed within every epoch. For instance, the H-alpha equivalent width is observed to vary within ~0.5 Ang over 40-min time scales, while there is an overall increase from ~4 Angs on March 17 to ~9 Angs on March 26. Contemporaneous Swift/XRT X-ray observations show a significant softening over the above period of time with hardness [(2-10 keV)/ (0.5-2 keV)] evolving from 0.65 to 0.45. We note that the observations are heavily affected by pile-up. This was preliminary corrected by excluding the central region of the aperture from the analysis. We are grateful to the GTC and VLT teams for their fast and efficient response to our ToO triggers. Evolution of the H-alpha line profile (VLT+X-Shooter):  "

The observations cover the spectral range between 3050 and 9500 Angstrom with a resolving power of ~65000. A preliminary analysis of the combined spectrum shows a bright continuum, resembling an A-type MS star peaking around 5300 Angstrom, characterised by the presence of hundreds of narrow absorption features and remarkable Balmer and Paschen jumps. We note the presence of a Halpha P-Cygni profile with blue-shifted heliocentric velocity with a minimum at v $\sim$ -340 km/s, and a narrow emission line characterised by a measured FWZI = 670 km/s and FWHM = 325 km/s. The brightest non-Balmer emission line is the O I 7773 line. We also report the presence of several multiplets of Fe II, with a P-Cygni absorption centered at a heliocentric velocity of v $\sim$ -250 km/s. This velocity is also reported for the Na I doublet. The interstellar Na doublet show three resolved components at heliocentric velocities of -0.2, -3.1 and -13.2 km/s respectively. The lack of a strong blue continuum, that is however typical of classical nova outburst, and the low expansion velocities suggest a possible different nature for this object. The presence of many narrow absorptions also suggests a similarity with other peculiar explosions, like the luminous red variable V4332 Sgr (Martini et al. 1999), the possible luminous red novae V838 Mon and V1309 Sco (Tylenda et al. 2011, Mason et al. 2010) or the 'helium-flash' explosion observed in the Sakurai object (Duerbeck and Benetti 1996).

857,ATEL #11469,"The ongoing All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) reported discovery of a new transient ASSASN-18fs on 2018 March 19. It was detected at ~13.2 mag in the V band (ATel #11442). The source was not detected at V>17.6 mag on 2018 March 17. ASAS-SN has monitored this part of the sky since February 2016 and no previous activity from this source has been detected. ASSASN-18fs was classified as dwarf nova outburst using follow-up spectroscopic observations (ATel #11452). We report on the follow-up Swift observations of the source carried out on 2018 March 22, <3 days after the source was discovered. All six UV and optical filters on board the Swift/UVOT were used and the source was observed for ~720 s (in total, across all six filters). The source is clearly detected in all the filters. The magnitudes in the Swift/UVOT AB photometric system from the various filters, along with the 1-sigma errors, are shown below. The source has dropped by ~1 mag in the V band since its reported detection ~3 days ago.

The spectrum extracted from this data had only ~10 counts and was not very constraining. Fitting it with an absorbed power-law model (with the Nh fixed at ~1.8e21 /cm^2; determined by the Nh along the line of sight to the source) resulted in a power-law index of ~2. The unabsorbed (0.5 - 10 keV) flux was 1.2e-12 erg/cm^2/s. The optical/UV broadband spectral shape as well as the very low X-ray count rate supports the dwarf nova nature of the source.

We obtained a series of three 600s spectra using the SPRAT (<a href="" "">Piascik et al. 2014</a>) instrument on the Liverpool Telescope (<a href="" "">Steele et al. 2004</a>). These spectra were taken in relatively poor conditions at an airmass of almost 2.

The H&alpha; P Cygni has a terminal velocity of ~2000 km/s. There may be tentative evidence for He I and/or Na-D emission lines. But further spectra are strongly encouraged. This spectrum strongly suggests that the initial classification in ATel #11470 is correct and this is a (the first) nova eruption to be observed in NGC 3109.

867,ATEL #11455,"The Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar PKS 0346-27 underwent a strong Gamma-ray flare on 2018-02-02 (Angioni et al., ATel #11251). Optical/NIR follow up with the REM telescope (Nesci, ATel #11269) on 2018-02-07 showed the source in a bright state also in this frequency range. Independent indication of an optical peak on 2018-02-21 was given by the ASAS-SN survey (Vallely et al., ATel #11337). Archival observations of the Catalina Sky Survey DR2 (Drake, A.J. et al. 2009, ApJ, 696, 870) from 2005 to 2013 indicate an optical variability amplitude of more than 2 magnitudes, but never brighter than V=17.8. We obtained a ToO exposure of 2300s with Swift-XRT and UVOT on 2018-03-19: PKS0346-27 was found at U=15.65 +-0.01 mag with a count-rate of 0.0704 +-0.0062 c/s in the 0.2-10 keV range. Spectral analysis with the interactive tool of the ASI SSDC gave a reasonable fit with a power-law photon index -2.08+-0.23, and a reduced chi2=0.44. The total flux in the 0.4-10 keV range is 2.0E-12 erg/cm2/s. In a log(nu)-log(nu*F_nu) plot (Fig.1) the X-ray SED is practically flat, suggesting that in this energy range the contribution of Synchrotron emission and Inverse Compton emission are comparable. The archival Swift observation in 2009-03-29 (3362s) gave U=17.53+-0.04 (U-V=-0.64) and an X-ray count rate of only 0.0174 +-0.0025 c/s, not enough to derive a meaningful spectral index. The ratio of the X-ray count rates between the two epochs is about 4.0 +-0.9, slightly smaller than the optical (U) flux ratio 5.6+-0.3. The Fermi-LAT public data show that PKS 0346-27 is still much brighter than the quiescent level. Our REM monitoring is still ongoing. Radio observations at high frequency would be desirable to better constraint the emission model of this flare. Fig. 1 shows the SED of PKS 0346-27 on 2018-03-19 from simultaneous Swift and REM data (crosses). The large dots are the UVOT data on 2009-03-29 and the XRT X-ray flux estimated from the count-rate, assuming the same photon index of the recent observation.

868,ATEL #11456,"We obtained a spectrum of ASASSN-18fv (ATel #11454), the new bright Galactic transient, with the Du Pont 2.5-m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory on UT 2018 Mar 21. The underlying spectrum appears to be that of an early K star, but we also observe P Cygni profiles in many lines: H-alpha, the Ca triplet, O I 7773, Mg I 5173, and several Fe II lines. The emission and absorption profiles are both unresolved at our ~ 400 km/s FWHM resolution. The higher order Balmer lines are seen only in absorption, and Paschen absorption is also present. There is an overall increase in the continuum emission between ~ 8300 and 9300 A that appears as a ""bump"" in the spectrum, but no obvious broad molecular features are apparent. We also corrected the astrometry of our acquisition image using a large number of Gaia DR1 stars. After doing so, we find that the transient matches to within 0.1"" a star in the Gaia DR1 catalog, which has a J2000 position of 10:36:15.4138 -59:35:53.648. This star is also present in VPHAS+ DR2 catalog (Drew et al 2014, MNRAS, 440, 2036), with g~20.1 and r ~ 19.5. From spectrophotometry of the fluxed spectrum and a first-order slit correction, we find magnitudes of g=7.80, r=7.27, i=7.19, B=8.07, V=7.45. The absolute fluxing is likely uncertain at the 10-20% level, but the colors (g-r = 0.53; B-V = 0.62) should be more reliable. The outburst g magnitude of 7.8 implies that the object has brightened by at least -12.3 mag in g. The strong, stellar-like underlying continuum and the narrow nature of the emission lines suggest that this transient is not likely to be a classical nova, though this cannot be definitively exluded. Instead, noting that this source is < 10 pc from the main nebulosity of the Carina Nebula, the transient may be a large outburst of a young stellar object. Other exotic explanations that show low expansion velocities, such as stellar mergers, may also be plausible. High-resolution optical/IR spectroscopy of this unusual transient is urgently required."
869,ATEL #11457,"We report follow-up B and V photometry of Galactic transient ASASSN-18fv (Stanek et al. ATEL #11454).

Adopting B=6.249 and V=5.088 for nearby star HD 92063 and using 20-arcsecond diameter aperture photometry, we find ASASSN-18fv had magnitudes of B=7.19 and V=6.62 at UT 2018-3-21.47. Our photometry is considerably brighter than the discovery photometry of Stanek et al. (ATEL 11454), who noted their photometry was potentially compromised by saturation and confusion. Additional UBVRI images and low resolution slitless spectroscopy (with a 200 line/mm diffraction grating) are being obtained with the Hutton-Westfold Observatory's 11-inch and 14-inch telescopes."

These observations were carried out on 2018 March 18 between 23:33 and 23:49 UT using the 2 m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), situated at Hanle and operated by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore. Imaging was in dithered mode and consisted of five exposures each in three dithered positions, with each exposure 20 seconds long. The transient can be associated with the 2MASS object (2MASS 18201471+0710574) having Vega magnitudes in J, H and Ks bands of 15.87 +/- 0.07, 15.44 +/- 0.10 and 15.12 +/- 0.12 respectively. Reduction of the data were carried out using PSF photometry. The derived instrumental magnitudes when calibrated against two stars in the same field namely 2MASS 18201851+0710328 and 2MASS 18202643+0710117 gave the following brightness of the source in the near-IR bands: J = 11.12 +/- 0.08 H = 10.24 +/- 0.04 Ks = 9.54 +/- 0.04 These magnitudes have been not corrected for Galactic extinction. Comparison of our observations with the 2MASS magnitudes indicates that the source has brightened by 4.75, 5.20 and 5.58 mag in J, H and Ks bands. Ks-band monitoring with HAWK-I/VLT and the above 2MASS association have also been reported by Casella et al. (ATel #11451), with our HCT observations preceding theirs by about 9 hours. Our Ks band measurement is about 0.7 mag brighter than the average mag reported by Casella et al., likely indicative of strong variations on min-hours timescales, in addition to the faster variability seen in HAWK-I. The above 2MASS mags correspond to flux densities of ~57 (J), 82 (H) and 102 mJy (Ks; Cohen, Wheaton & Megeath 2003 AJ 126 1090). Galactic extinction corrections are likely to be <17%, <10% and <7%, respectively, based upon the range of optical extinction estimates reported so far (ATel #11418, #11437, #11445) and for a typical Galactic reddening law (Fitzpatrick 1999 PASP 111 755). This implies that the near-infrared flux density rises to longer wavelengths, possibly consistent with optically-thin jet emission. There is multiwavelength spectral and timing evidence supporting the presence of jet activity (e.g. ATel #11420, #11426, #11437, #11439, #11440, #11451). X-ray spectral modeling of a Swift Window Timing mode XRT observation from the same day (ObsID 00010627007 with an observation time of 2018-03-18T02:52:56) is consistent with an approximate power law fit of photon-index 1.52 +/- 0.03 (68% confidence error) over the 3-9 keV range, with chi^2/dof=641/581 and Flux(3-9)~1.3x10^{-8} erg/s/cm^2. The H-band and 3-9 keV fluxes place the source close to the hard state outburst rise track of the black hole binary GX 339-4 (Coriat et al. 2009 MNRAS 400 123). We will attempt to carry out further observations of this ongoing transient."

872,ATEL #11460,"Observations of ASASSN-18fv (ATel# 11454) were obtained on 2018 Mar. 21.49 (MJD 58199.0), with an Alpy600 spectrograph having a resolution of about 540 in the range 3800-7300A using a Atik414 CCD and a total exposure time 5x120 sec. The spectrum confirms that this source is a classical nova on the rise in the optically thick (Fe curtain) phase, The Fe II 5018, 5169 lines, for instance, show absorption troughs (about as strong as the emission) extending to about -800 km/s, about the same as the zero intensity width of the redshifted emission wing. The Balmer lines (H-alpha to H-gamma) show absorption with similar maximum velocities and strongly decreasing emission-to-absorption ratio with increasing line number, similar profiles and kinematics are found on Si II 6347,6371 and other metallic ion lines. Ca II H and K are mainly in absorption, as are the Na I D lines, but the absorption is displaced by about But in both cases the profiles are broad and poorly resolved, although the Na I D is centered at about vrad=0 km/s while Ca II K has a vrad ~ -400 km/s deepest absorption and a similar maximum absorption velocity, suggesting the Na I line is dominated by interstellar absorption. Neither O I nor He I are seen in this spectrum. The optical depth is quite large now and, with these absorption velocities, it would be of interest to obtain high resolution time sequences to study the appearance of multiple absorption systems and track the changes in ejecta transparency.

875,ATEL #11445,"Following the detection of the newly discovered X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11399, #11400, #11403, #11404, #11406, #11418), we have started a polarimetric monitoring campaign of the source. Here we report the first detection of the linear polarization obtained on March 18, 2018, around 14:52 UTC (JD 2458196.120). The measurements were done with the Dipol-2 polarimeter, which is currently installed on the Tohoku 60cm (T60) telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii. Observations have been made simultaneously in the Johnson-Cousins B, V and R-bands over the time interval of approximately two hours. The total number of single measurements of the normalized Stokes parameters is 48. The average values of linear polarization and polarization angle for the B, V and R-bands are given below: B-band: P = 0.74 +/- 0.02(%), Theta = 53.0 +/- 0.7(deg); V-band: P = 0.71 +/- 0.03(%), Theta = 53.6 +/- 1.1(deg); R-band: P = 0.78 +/- 0.02(%), Theta = 54.5 +/- 0.7(deg). Thus the measured magnitude of linear polarization is below 1%. The value of interstellar polarization in the direction of the MAXI J1820+070 can be estimated from the reddening of the source, given that normally polarization degree PD(ISM) < 9 x E(B-V). An estimate of the reddening was given in ATel#11418 E(B-V) = 0.167, that corresponds to a Hydrogen column density of NH = 1.12 x 10^21 cm-2. However, in the Swift/XRT spectrum taken on March 13, 2018 (OBSID: 00010627002) the best fitting hydrogen column was an order of magnitude lower, NH = 1.2 (\pm 0.4) x 10^20 cm-2, which gives a much lower reddening estimate, AV= 0.055 (Guver & Ozel, 2009) or AV= 0.067, if one uses the relation of Predehl and Schmitt NH=AV x 1.8E21. For these lower values we get E(B-V) = AV/RV = 0.015 or 0.019, respectively, assuming RV=3.6. The discrepancy between the extinction values suggests that MAXI J1820+070 is closer to the Earth than the majority of the ISM in that direction. If the correct reddening corresponds to these low values measured from the X-ray spectrum, the measured polarization degrees are significantly above the expected interstellar polarization level. For the higher reddening values, the observed polarization is consistent with that coming from the ISM. Further observations of the source are planned in order to detect variations and to verify if the measured polarization is intrinsic."

Assuming that the source flux was constant over each transit at 14:23 and 17:28 on the same day, we obtain the source position at (R.A., Dec) = (264.733 deg, -37.948 deg) = (17 38 55, -37 56 52) (J2000) with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short radii of 0.41 deg and 0.34 deg, respectively. The roll angle of the long axis from the north direction is 180.0 deg counterclockwise. There is an additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment radius). The X-ray flux averaged over the two scans was 37 +- 11 mCrab (4.0-10.0keV, 1 sigma error). Preliminary GSC data analysis showed that the source flux in the 4-10 keV band has been increasing since March 14, whereas the 2-4 keV flux rapidly increased to about 20 mCrab on March 14 and declined. The gamma-ray source IGR J17379-3747 (Bird et al. 2007, ApJS, 170, 175, also see Curran et al. 2013, arXiv 1107.2045v1) lies 0.26 deg from the center of the above error region. Interestingly, Swift/BAT 15-50 keV data (Krimm et al. 2013, ApJSS 209, 14;  ) also showed slight increase in the X-ray flux on March 14-18, but which was not significant on March 19 ((-0.2+/-3.0)e-3 c/cm2/s). On the other hand, the INTEGRAL Galactic Bulge Monitoring Program (Kuulkers et al. 2003, A&A, 466, 595;  ) data demonstrate a long-term upward trend in hard X-rays for about 100 days. IGR J17379-3747 exhibited outbursts on February 2004 and September 2008 (e.g., ATel #1709, #1711, #1714; also see by C. Markwardt  ). MAXI/GSC data also showed weak 2-10 keV X-ray enhancement (~10 mCrab) probably from this source in the middle of February 2014. These suggest that IGR J17379-3747 undergoes outbursts every 4-5 years.

HAWK-I observed the target on Mar 19, 2018, between 08:27 and 09:09 UT, in Ks filter. We used the FastJitter mode, with 64-px windows and a DIT=250 milliseconds. The night was photometric, with a variable seeing between 0.5 and 1.0 arcseconds. The source is clearly detected in each single DIT. Its position is consistent with a 2MASS object (K = 15.12 +/- 0.12), but appears to have brightened substantially. Preliminary analysis shows the source is rather variable, with an average magnitude of Ks ~ 10.2 and a ~25% average rms variability. The magnitude - not corrected for the Galactic extinction - was calibrated against a nearby field comparison star (2MASS 18202191+0711248, K = 12.029 +/- 0.027). According to our photometry, the target has brightened by almost two orders of magnitude in Ks with respect to the 2MASS value, which likely corresponds to the quiescence of the object (ATel #11418). Two additional epochs of fast IR photometry are planned for March 22nd and 27th, around the same UT range (end of 21st and 26th Chilean nights)™.

We extracted the data using the online XRT pipeline (Evans et al. 2009) and fit with an absorbed power-law model. We find a best fit with an N_H of (3.0 +/- 0.5)E20 cm<sup>-2</sup> and a photon index of 1.50 +/- 0.02, providing an unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV X-ray flux of (8.96 +/- 0.08)E-9 erg/s/cm^2, corresponding to a 0.5-10 keV X-ray luminosity of (6.87 +/- 0.15)E37*(d/8kpc)^2 erg/s (all errors are 1-sigma). The X-ray and radio luminosities reported here are consistent with evidence at other wavelengths that suggest the source is a black hole X-ray binary in the rising hard state (ATel #11427, #11432). We will continue to monitor the source at sub-mm frequencies. We thank the IRAM NOEMA staff for rapidly scheduling our observations and the AMI scheduling team for their continued monitoring of the source."
887,ATEL #11441,"A visual-wavelength optical spectrum of AT2018aes obtained on UT 2018 Mar 13 (JD 2458190.84) with the Magellan Clay telescope (+ LDSS3 spectrograph, VPH-all grism) reveals a narrow H-alpha emission line with a velocity of 525 km/s, with wings extending to roughly +/-1000 km/s. This suggests a Type IIn classification. Additionally, however, narrow emission lines of [Ca II] 7291,7324 and intermediate-width emission lines of Ca II 8498, 8542, 8662 are seen. The presence of the calcium emission lines combined with an absolute magnitude of -12.6 (using a distance modulus of NGC5300 from NED of 30.96) indicate that this object may be a supernova impostor or intermediate-luminosity optical transient, similar to events like SN 2002bu, SN 2008S, or SN 2010dn (Prieto 2008, ATel #1550; Smith et al., 2011, MNRAS, 415, 773)."

The 15-200 keV spectrum of MAXI J1820+070, averaged in the time interval MJD 58190.004-58192.264 (about 42 ks exposure), is well fit by the thermal Comptonisation model NTHCOMP (reduced Chi^2=1.07(172)).

A previous Fermi-LAT high state of this source in the period 2017 Sept 15-27 was potentially associated with the Ice Cube Neutrino detection 170922A (ATel #10791). TXS 0506+056 is a BL Lac object (e.g. ATel #10799) with redshift z=0.34 (Paiano et al, 2018, ApJ, 854, L32). We obtained optical polarimetry of the BL Lac object on the night of 2018 March 14 using the RINGO3 polarimeter of the 2.0 metre Liverpool Telescope, La Palma. We find the polarisation is moderately strong (P~14%) at wavelengths roughly corresponding to the R and I bands. This is an increase from the R band polarisation P~8% reported in ATel #10844 from the Katana telescope at the time of the previous high state on 2017 Sept 30, although it is within the typical range of BL Lac optical polarisation values of 0-30% (see e.g. Figure 4 of Jermak et al, 2016, MNRAS, 462, 4267).

895,ATEL #11431,"A fast radio burst has been detected at the Parkes Telescope on 2018-03-11 at 04:11:54.80 UTC (ATeL #11396). The INTEGRAL observatory was taking data on a field centered at RA=260.177, Dec=-40.105, 43.0 degrees from the approximate FRB arrival direction (RA=21:31:33.42 Dec=-57:44:26.7). This orientation is rather favorable for a detection of any associated gamma-ray transient with INTEGRAL's all-sky detectors (see <a href="" "">Savchenko et al., 2017, A&A 603, A46</a> for details). The best constraints can be achieved using the anti-coincidence shield ofthe spectrometer (SPI-ACS) or the imager (IBIS/ISGRI), depending on the assumed source spectrum and exact location. We inspected these data, which have a stable background within at least a 10-minute window of the FRB occurrence time, and derive an upper limit on any associated impulsive gamma-ray transient. We estimate a 3-sigma upper limit on the 75-2000 keV fluence of 2.6e-7 erg/cm<sup>2</sup> for a burst lasting less than 1 s with a characteristic short GRB spectrum (an exponentially cut-off power-law with alpha=-0.5 and Ep=600 keV) occurring at any time in the interval within 300 s around T<sub>0</sub>. For a typical long GRB spectrum (Band function with alpha=-1, beta=-2.5, and Ep=300 keV), the derived fluence upper limit in 8 s is 7.1e-7 erg/cm<sup>2</sup> in the 75-2000 keV energy range. The limits are applicable within at least 5 deg around the approximate FRB180311 position."
896,ATEL #11432,"MAXI J1820+070 is a new X-ray transient discovered on 2018 March 11 12:50 UT by MAXI (ATel #11399), and associated with a bright optical transient ASASSN-18ey (ATel #11400). It has already been the focus of several observing campaigns over a very short time span, including Swift (ATel #11403, #11404, #11406, #11427), MAXI (ATel #11406), Faulkes/LCO (ATel #11418), AMI (ATel #11420), Sarah L. Krizmanich Telescope (ATel #11421), NICER (ATel #11423), SOAR (ATel #11424), Keck (ATel #11425), and Kiso Schmidt (ATel #11426). These observations have noted its rapid brightening, fast optical variability, and sub-second flaring. They also indicate a nature consistent with a black hole X-ray binary in the hard state ( ). We report now on correlated optical and X-ray observations by Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory UVOT/XRT (ObsID: 00010627003). The observation was carried out on 2018 March 15, starting at 01:39 (UT), for a duration of 1.8 ks (XRT) and 1.2 ks (UVOT). UVOT was employed in the event mode with the v-filter and XRT was in Windowed Timing Mode. Standard extraction steps were used for selecting and accumulating source counts and constructing light curves. Example light curves using 1 s binning are shown at the link below. No time frame corrections have been included since both lightcurves are from Swift. The mean count rates are ~184 ct/s (XRT full band) and ~100 ct/s (UVOT). The X-ray data were extracted from the Swift Online Tool. The mean signal/noise in UVOT is ~7, and the fractional optical rms of the source (after removing shot noise contribution) is ~9%, typical of hard-state outbursts (e.g. Gandhi et al. 2010 MNRAS 407 2166). A Discrete Correlation Function analysis (Edelson & Krolik, 1988 ApJ 333 646) shows the optical signal lagging the X-rays by a few seconds or shorter (see link below). This lag is also evident by eye in the light curves showing correlated flares. The bulk of the correlation appears to be concentrated below a lag of 10 s. These lags are shorter than UVOT lags reported in the case of the rise of V404 Cyg (ATel #7727). If these lags are related to canonical reprocessing of X-rays to the optical, they constrain the size of the disc to be <~0.2 x that of V404 Cyg, or an orbital period of <~15 h x (M/10Msun)^(-0.5), where M is the system mass. This assumes a disk size of ~45 light seconds and an orbital period of 6.5 days for V404 Cyg (Casares et al. 1992 Nature 355 614). There is some evidence of additional sub-second delays, but these must be confirmed with more sensitive data. It is not uncommon for transient black hole binary outbursts to display multi-component optical variability and delays originating in separate processes (e.g. Gandhi et al. 2010 MNRAS 407 2166). Swift BAT reports that the source is continuing to increase in X-rays ( ). The latest optical data shows the source currently at V~13 (ATel #11418). More observations are currently planned for this source. ULTRACAM will attempt to observe from approximately 08:30 to 09:40 (UT) when possible until March 23, and there are also observations by VLBA, INTEGRAL, AMI, XMM and NOEMA currently scheduled. More information on these observations can be found on SMARTNet, where people are encouraged to sign in:   In the interests of multiwavelength astronomy, and considering the bright and intriguing nature of this source, we therefore welcome any and all possible observations. We would like to extend our profound thanks to the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team for their rapid approval scheduling of these observations, in particular PI Brad Cenko. We would also like to acknowledge discussions with Andy Beardmore, Sam Oates and Dave Russell. Swift UVOT/XRT Timing Correlations in MAXI J1820+070:  "
897,ATEL #11433,"We obtained spectroscopic observations of SN 2018agk with the Goodman spectrograph on the 4-m SOAR telescope on 2018 Mar 16 UT. The spectrum indicates that SN 2018agk is a young Type Ia supernova. Using SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024), we find a good match to several Type Ia SNe 3-10 days before maximum brightness. We note that the small number of SNe Ia observed at very early phases often results in a bias to later phases. The SN was discovered at 20.2 mag, which assuming a distance modulus of 35.3 mag for the host galaxy IC 855 (based on its redshift), corresponds to an absolute magnitude of -15.2 -- or ~4 mag below peak brightness. We measure an Si II 6355 velocity of -11,200 km/s. We detect a possible C II 6580 feature (an additional indication of a young age) with a velocity of -11,300 km/s."

The flare lasted three days, reached about 19.1 mag in OGLE I-band at maximum (host subtracted) and coincided with the nucleus of a small galaxy. The galaxy coincided with WISE J051811.72-514404.0, a candidate BL Lac type object identified by D'Abrusco et al. (2014, ApJS, 215, 14) on the basis of its WISE colors and identification with the radio source SUMSS J051811-514404 (76.0 mJy at 843 MHz; Mauch et al. 2003, MNRAS, 342, 1117). The radio source is also detected with astrometric VLBI: 05:18:11.727160, -51:44:03.97925 +/-2.6 mas J2000 (30 mJy at 8.4 GHz; Petrov and Kovalev, in preparation   ). The X-ray source XMMSL2 J051811.6-514354 is located 10"" away and, despite the reported 4.3"" uncertainty in its position, is likely associated with the transient. We obtained a spectrum of OGLE18wc on 2018-02-19 using the VLT/FORS2 with grism 600V (3500-6300A). Additional low resolution spectra were obtained with SALT/RSS (3500-9200A) on 2018-02-20 and 2018-03-04. The spectra suggest rapid evolution, but the difference between the VLT and SALT spectra can be also partly attributed to the slit alignment. The first (VLT) spectrum shown Hb, Hg, [OIII] and [OII] emission lines and absorption lines of Ca II H&K, G-band and Mg I at z=0.22. In the second (SALT) spectrum Hb disappears, strong Iron complexes 4500A and 5500A are present. A broad Ha alpha is visible having FWHM~4000km/s. The third (SALT) spectrum is similar to the second one but flux in red part has decreased by about 25%. Swift observed OGLE18wc for 2.0ks on 2018-02-21. The XRT detected an X-ray source with the net count rate of 0.013 +/-0.003 cts/s located 3.5"" (error radius is 5.8"") from the optical transient. Fixing the absorbing column density to the Galactic value in the direction of the source, n_H1 = 1.63x10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005 A&A, 440, 775), the spectrum can be fit with the absorbed power law with the photon index of 2.15 +/-0.40 and the unabsorbed 0.3-10 keV flux of 4.3x10^-13 ergs/cm^2/s. An UV source is detected at the position of the transient with the following UVOT Vega magnitudes: Band Mag. Err.

The Swift X-ray detection and blue UV colors together with the irregular lightcurve observed by OGLE-IV, WISE colors and archival VLBI detection suggest that OGLE18wc is a flaring blazar. The optical spectra of OGLE18wc resemble the spectrum of Mrk 501, a high-synchrotron peaked BL Lac type object that has a significant contribution from its host galaxy light in the optical band (Abdo et al. 2011, ApJ, 727, 129). OGLE18wc shows similarities to our spectra of the Fermi-detected transient ASASSN-17gs/AT2017egv (ATel #10642) recently identified as a radio-weak BL Lac by Bruni et al. (2018, ApJ, 854L, 23).

The previous OGLE-IV observations show the transient slowly rising to I=19.2 since the first detection on 2018-01-21. We obtained the spectrum of OGLE18act on 2018-03-10 using the FOcal Reducer/low dispersion Spectrograph 2 (FORS2) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The spectrum reveals blue continuum with superimposed emission lines of the Balmer series, [O II], [O III] and faint [S II] at redshift z=0.078. Balmer emission lines have a very complex shape. An unresolved narrow emission peak (FWHM ~<500 km/s) is superimposed on a broad component with an extended red wing (total width ~10000 km/s). There is a narrow absorption feature blue shifted by 700-800 km/s with respect to the narrow emission component. Swift observed OGLE18act for 4.1ks on 2018-03-14. The XRT detected no X-ray source at the position of the transient with an upper limit of 0.004 cts/s. Assuming power law emission with the photon index of 2 and HI column density of 3.07x10^20 cm^-2 this translates to the unabsorbed 0.3-10 keV flux limit of 1.4x10^-13 ergs/cm^2/s.

900,ATEL #11436,"We report the VERITAS discovery of very-high-energy emission (VHE; >100 GeV) from the FRI radio galaxy 3C 264, also known as NGC 3862. Nearly 12 hours of quality selected data, collected by VERITAS between 09 February 2018 and 16 March 2018 (UTC), were analyzed. Preliminary results yield an excess of 60 gamma-ray events above background at the position of the source, corresponding to a statistical significance of 5.4 standard deviations. Our preliminary flux estimate (E>300 GeV) is (1.3 &plusmn 0.2)e-12 cm^-2 s^-1, or approximately 1% of the Crab Nebula flux above the same threshold. The Fermi-LAT 3FHL catalog (Ackermann et al. 2017 ApJS 232, 18) lists a photon index of 1.65 &plusmn 0.33 for 3C 264 which, when extrapolated to the VHE band, is consistent with the VERITAS detection. At a redshift of 0.0217, 3C 264 is a more distant analog to M87, with superluminal motion of ~7c (Meyer et al. 2015, Nature 521, 495) detected in its kpc-scale optical jet. With this discovery, 3C 264 is the most distant radio galaxy detected at VHE so far. VERITAS will continue to observe 3C 264; multi-wavelength observations are encouraged.

901,ATEL #11437,"Hole, Transient The new X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070/ASASSN-18ey (ATel #11399, #11400) may be a bright and rapidly-rising hard state black hole binary in outburst (ATel #11403, #11404, #11406, #11418, #11420, #11421, #11423, #11424, #11425, #11426, #11427, #11432). We observed the source with the fast triple-beam camera ULTRACAM (Dhillon et al. 2007 378 825) at NTT/La Silla from UT 08:45 to UT 10:10 on 2018 March 16 in the SDSS u'g'i' filters. We used ULTRACAM's drift mode and 50 pixel windows to image at a frame rate of 72.5 Hz, with a mean deadtime of 1.2 ms. The sky was photometric, with seeing ~1-2 arcseconds throughout. The g' and i' lightcurves described here were extracted using optimal photometry without bias or flat field corrections. Dereddened median source mags are g'=12.03 and i'=12.24, calibrated against a field comparison star observed simultaneously in a second ULTRACAM window, and also corrected for Galactic extinction of A(g')=0.76 mag and A(i')=0.39 mag (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011 ApJ 737 103). The comparison star is URAT1 486-270264 (Zacharias et al. 2015 ApJ 150 4) at RA=18h20m26.43s, Dec=+07d10m11.8s. Illustrative light curve segments are shown at the link below. The observation reveals spectacular flaring activity over a range of timescales. Strong sub-second variations with some flares unresolved on the native cycle time of ~13.8 ms are apparent (see also ATel #11426). As a prominent example, the strongest i' flare peaks a factor of ~4.3 in flux (Delta mag ~1.6) above the adjacent mean flux level, has a duration of only ~0.3 s and shows clear shorter sub-structure. The median signal-to-noise per frame is 24 (i') and 19 (g'). The sub-second flaring is strongly red, with a maximum colour change (g'-i') of ~1.24 mag above the median(g'-i') colour of ~ -0.20. There is a clear trend of the source being redder when brighter (see link below). Power spectra show that the variability is dominated by a strong and broad hump spanning ~0.1-10 Hz and peaking just above 1 Hz, stronger in the red. There is also evidence of a weaker high frequency component around ~20 Hz, and possible quasi-periodicities at low frequencies between ~0.01-0.05 Hz. The fractional rms variability amplitude (Vaughan et al. 2003 MNRAS 345 1271) is 0.22 and 0.12 in i' and g', respectively. These characteristics are strongly reminiscent of those seen in the hard state of the black hole binary GX 339-4, which also showed red flaring with a power spectral peak around 1 Hz in the optical and near-infrared (Gandhi et al. 2010 MNRAS 407 2166, Casella et al. 2010 MNRAS 404 L21) whose origin has been associated with compact jet activity. MAXI J1820+070 has recently displayed a bright radio counterpart consistent with the presence of a jet (ATel #11420). These facts suggest that we are likely seeing optical synchrotron activity in MAXI J1820+070 with a variability spectrum peaking in the red. The short optical flaring timescales point to a compact emission zone. The origin of these flares can be further tested by searching for sub-second optical/infrared delays with respect to X-rays, and we encourage rapid simultaneous multiwavelength observations to detect and monitor any evolution in such delays (e.g. Gandhi et al. 2017 Nat. Astron. 1 859). Very few such observations exist during outburst rise and the present bright outburst presents an excellent opportunity in this regard. ULTRACAM will attempt to observe the source at every opportunity over the coming week, typically near the end of Chilean night (~08:30UT [or earlier] into morning twilight). Anyone interested in coordination should contact the authors, or sign up to SMARTNet ( ). PG thanks Phil Uttley for discussions. ULTRACAM observations of MAXI J1820+070:  "
902,ATEL #11438,"The optical follow-up observations of FRB 180301 (Price et al., ATel #11376) by GWAC_F60 telescope were made during 12:02:25 and 13:17:40 UT, Mar. 2, 2018, about 28.5 hours after the burst. GWAC_F60 is a 60cm optical telescope and is located at Xinglong observatory, China. This telescope is operated by GuangXi university and National Astronomical Observatories, CAS, and dedicated to observe the optical counterparts of short duration astronomical transients, like GRB, FRB, GW. The weather was not good during the observations. Due to the small FoV of about 9 arcmin for GWAC-F60, a mapping of 9 fields was applied in order to cover the whole 1 sigma error circle of this burst. No any new source is detected in the stacked images. The 5 sigma upper limit is estimated to be about R~16.7 mag, calibrated by the USNO B1.0 R2 magnitude."
903,ATEL #11421,"The transient MAXI J1820+070 (= ASASSN-18ey; ATel #11399, #11400) is an outbursting low-mass X-ray binary in which the accreting object is suspected to be a black hole (ATel #11418). Between approximately 8-11 UTC on 2018 March 15, I obtained unfiltered, time-series photometry of this object with the 80-cm Sarah L. Krizmanich Telescope at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana (USA). Individual exposures were 2 seconds long, with an overall cadence of 5 seconds per image. As shown in the light curve at the link below, the system displayed chaotic variability during these observations. The top panel of the linked figure shows the full light curve, while the bottom panel zooms in on a representative 30-minute segment so that individual points may be seen more clearly. The source flickered almost constantly, undergoing many flares that lasted for only a few seconds. A few exceptional flares were a half-magnitude in amplitude, but the typical flare amplitude was 0.2-0.3 mag. The system's average magnitude was approximately 13.0 (bandpass: unfiltered with a Johnson V zeropoint). To confirm that the fast variability was not an artifact caused by scintillation noise or seeing variations, I inspected light curves of several check stars in the field, and even though they were considerably fainter than MAXI J1820+070, they showed comparatively little scatter (RMS = 0.02 mag). Given that much of the observed variability occurred on timescales of less than 5 seconds, it is important to utilize as rapid a cadence as possible when obtaining time-series photometry of this object.

904,ATEL #11422,"We report the MAXI/GSC detection of a new candidate superburst from GS 1826-238. The event from GS 1826-238 was found in MAXI/GSC observations on 2018 Feb 12 (MJD 58161). No superburst was observed from this source yet. The event was detected at 18:34 UT and lasted for at least 3 hours (three scan transits for MAXI) with a fast-rise and exponential-decay light curve. The spectrum of each of the three scan transits is well fitted by an absorbed blackbody model with temperatures kT = 1.8 (+/- 0.2), 1.5 (+/- 0.2) and 1.3 (+0.3, -0.2) keV at 18:34, 20:07 and 21:39 UT, respectively. The hydrogen column density was fixed at 0.28 x10<sup>22</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> (Ono et al 2016, PASJ, 68, 14). The bolometric flux declined from 2.9 (+/- 0.4) x10<sup>-8</sup> to 1.5 (+/- 0.3) x10<sup>-8</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup> over the course of 3 hours. The e-folding decay time is 4.3 (+5.5, -1.5) hours. Since these results prove a long decay time of the burst (more than an hour) and cooling along the decay, we conclude that this is the first superburst observed from GS 1826-238."

906,ATEL #11424,"On 2018 Mar 6, ASAS-SN discovered an optical transient toward the inner galaxy. Subsequently MAXI J1820+070 was discovered as a new X-ray transient (ATel #11399), and D. Denisenko suggested the two transients were associated (ATel #11400). Subsequent X-ray and optical observations strengthened this association, and led to the conclusion that this source is likely a new black hole X-ray binary (ATels #11406, #11418, 11420, 11421 , 11423). We obtained optical spectroscopy of this source on UT 2018 March 15.4 with the Goodman Spectrograph on the SOAR telescope. We obtained both a low resolution spectrum (wavelength range 3000-7000 A, resolution 5.6 A) and a moderate resolution spectrum (5500-6750 A, resolution 1.7 A). The low resolution spectrum shows strong, broad H-alpha emission and weaker emission from He I 5875 and the Bowen blend. In the medium resolution spectrum, the H-alpha has a FWHM of about 1150 km/s. It is asymmetric but not clearly double-peaked, possibly due to the modest S/N of our spectrum. This FWHM is relatively low for a black hole X-ray transient, suggesting either that the system has a long period associated with an evolved donor or that it is relatively face-on. There are no obvious absorption features in the spectrum, indicating that continuum is dominated by the accretion disk. The optical position of ASASSN-18ey/MAXI J1820+070 is consistent with a star in archival data, and this star has a Gaia DR1 J2000 position of 18:20:21.9393, +07:11:07.190, with a nominal astrometric uncertainty of a few milliarcseconds per coordinate."

We confirm the presence of a broad, asymmetric H-alpha emission line (ATel #11424). We also detect broad H-beta, H-gamma, and H-delta absorption with emission lines in the center, characteristic of an accretion disk in outburst. He II 4686 (with EW = -1.7 Ang) is seen on top of the continuum. We also see deep Ca II interstellar absorption in the blue, suggesting significant extinction along the line-of-sight.

CZTI is a coded aperture mask instrument that has considerable effective area for about 29% of the entire sky, but is also sensitive to brighter transients from the entire sky. At the instant of the FRB, AstroSat was pointing at (RA = 189.2, DEC = 62.3): about 157 degrees away from the nominal FRB direction. CZTI data were de-trended to remove orbit-wise background variation. We then searched data from the four independent, identical quadrants to look for coincident spikes in the count rates. Searches were undertaken by binning the data in 0.01s, 0.1s, and 1s respectively. Statistical fluctuations in count rates were estimated by using data from 10 neighbouring orbits. We selected confidence levels such that the probability of a false trigger in this 200s window is 10^-4. We do not find any evidence for any hard X-ray transient in this window, in the CZTI energy range of 20-200 keV.

909,ATEL #11418,"We report on optical observations of the newly discovered transient MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11399, #11400, #11403, #11404, #11406). We performed optical (g', i') observations of the field with the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) 1-m robotic telescope located at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, Chile, on March 13th, 2018 (MJD 58190.38) obtaining one 200-second integration image of the field for each filter. The optical counterpart is clearly detected with the following AB magnitudes: g'=13.14 +/- 0.03 i'=13.08 +/- 0.05 These values are not corrected for Galactic extinction (nH=1.12E21 cm^-2 in the direction of the source; Dickey & Lockman, 1990, ARAA, 28, 215; Kalberla et al. 2005, A&A, 440, 775), that corresponds to Av=0.51 +/- 0.02 according to the NH/Av relation of Guver & Ozel 2009. The calibration of the magnitudes was performed against a group of PanStarrs bright stars in the field of the target. In the PanStarrs catalogue, moreover, the magnitudes of a faint object at a position that is coincident with that of the source are tabulated (g'=19.381 +/- 0.073, i'= 18.039 +/- 0.101). This faint target is therefore likely to be the optical counterpart of MAXI J1820+070 during quiescence. From this, we could infer the amplitude of the outburst, that so far is 6.24 +/- 0.08 mag and 4.96 +/- 0.11 mag in the g' and i' bands, respectively. According to the empirical relation between outburst amplitude and orbital period for LMXBs (Shahbaz & Kuulkers 1998, MNRAS, 295, L1), this implies the orbital period is likely to be < 11.6 hours. Assuming the source is near the far side of this Galactic dust, we corrected for the reddening (E(B-V)=0.163 +/- 0.007), and obtained the unabsorbed optical fluxes per unit frequency. Considering the 2-10 keV unabsorbed flux measured by MAXI on the same day (3.2839 +- 0.3893 E-9 erg/cm2/s), we could place MAXI J1820+070 on the optical/X-ray correlation plot for BH- and NS- X-ray binaries (Russell et al. 2006, MNRAS, 371, 1334; 2007, MNRAS, 379, 1108), adopting various possible distances for the source (0.3, 1, 3, 8, 20 kpc); see link below. We find that MAXI J1820+070 lies in a region of the diagram that is consistent with a black hole X-ray binary, for any reasonable distance. Only for distances << 1 kpc could the optical/X/-ray ratio be consistent with a typical neutron star X-ray binary. We can rule out a high-mass X-ray binary due to the 6-mag amplitude of the outburst, and the source is likely too X-ray bright to be an accreting white dwarf (it is still rising according to the MAXI light curve). We therefore tentatively claim that MAXI J1820+070 is a new black hole candidate low-mass X-ray binary, although confirmation (ideally dynamical, which may be possible in quiescence) will be required. Further multiwavelength observations are strongly encouraged in order to prove the nature of the source.

This source is also included in the 3FHL catalog (Ajello et al. 2017, ApJS, 232, 18, as 3FHL J0509.4+0542).

Preliminary analysis indicates that on 13 March 2018 this source was in a high-flux state, with a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (0.4+/-0.1) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty only). This corresponds to a flux increase of a factor of about 5.5 relative to the average flux reported in the third Fermi LAT catalog (3FGL) and is the highest daily averaged flux detected from this object. The corresponding photon spectral index of 1.8+/-0.1 is significantly harder than the 3FGL value 2.04+/-0.03. Some high energy (E > 10 GeV) photons have also been detected in the past few days. This source lies in the error region of the extremely high-energy (EHE) IceCube-170922A neutrino event ( , ATel#10773, #10787) and the LAT detected a flaring state close to that neutrino event (ATel#10791). Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring of this source region will continue. In consideration of the ongoing activity of this source we encourage multiwavelength observations. For this source the Fermi-LAT contact person is Sara Buson (sara.buson@gmail.com). The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.

Observations by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory began shortly after, on 2018 Mar 09. UVOT grism data were collected on Mar 09 (day 10.7-10.8 after outburst). The 2.6 ks exposure provides a spectrum that shows the presence of a broad Mg II 2800 &Aring; emission line, and UV absorption features of the iron curtain. The iron curtain lifts later in the UV than in the optical. Due to the presence of this absorption and a noisy spectrum, only a rough estimate of the FWZI of 10,000 km s<sup>-1</sup> for the Mg II line can be made.

922,ATEL #11412,"Preliminary Fermi LAT analysis reveals enhanced gamma-ray activity from the direction of the Crab Nebula. The daily-averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV) on 11 March 2018 from the direction of the Crab Nebula was (4.9 +/- 0.5) x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1. This is a factor of ~2 greater than the average gamma-ray flux of (2.71 +/- 0.02) x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1 reported in the third Fermi-LAT source catalog (Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23). The flux values in the last two 6-hour periods of 11 March 2018 were ~ (6.0 +/- 1.0) x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1. All fluxes given are the sums of the pulsar and nebular emission, and with statistical uncertainties only. These are the highest gamma-ray fluxes observed for the Crab since October 2016 (ATel 9588). Fermi will interrupt the currently planned observations and maximize the coverage toward the Crab nebula for at least 350 ks. This source is one of the ""LAT Monitored Sources"" and consequently a preliminary estimation of the daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi LAT is publicly available (  ). We strongly encourage further multifrequency observations of this region. For this source the Fermi LAT contact person is Rolf Buehler (rolf.buehler@desy.de).

During these observations we commensally search for fast radio bursts (FRBs) using the BPSR backend and Heimdall algorithm (Barsdell et al. 2011). We have now detected our third FRB during the commensal search since commencing in June 2017. Astronomer’s Telegrams <a href=  "">11046</a> and <a href="" "">11385</a> describe the discovery of the two previous bursts and the same setup was used to discover the burst described below. On 2018-03-11 at 04:11:54.80 UTC (2018-03-11.17493981481), we detected a burst with a signal to noise ratio (S/N) of 11.5, at the dispersion measure (DM) of 1575.6 pc cm^-3, in the field of the millisecond pulsar PSR J2129-5721 (DM = 31.58 pc cm^-3). The burst was detected in the beam 4 of the receiver, which at the time was pointed at a position of (RA, DEC 21:31:33.42, -57:44:26.7). The burst width (full width at half maximum) was 12 ms and the early estimate of fluence is 2.4 Jy ms. We note that the location of the burst within the telescope beam is highly uncertain (> 0.25 deg) at the moment; consequently, the fluence measurement is biased low (Macquart & Ekers 2017). This position is approximately -43.7 degrees off of the galactic plane. The galactic contribution is estimated to be 45.287 pc cm^-3 from the NE2001 model (Cordes & Lazio, 2001) and 32.06 from the YWM16 model (Yao et al. 2017). Assuming host contribution to the DM of 100 pc cm<sup>-3</sup>, we estimate the redshift to be about 2.

Outburst amplitude from quiescent Gaia Gmag=17.8 is also typical for dwarf novae.

The variable in SSS data is always in the 17.0-17.8 range, except for two outliers with large errors and one spurious detection at 15.8m. Then, the star has a huge color index between the ultraviolet and infrared bands: (FUV-W1)=8.3 . It has an UV counterpart GALEX J124850.7-412654 with magnitudes FUV=21.31+/-0.35, NUV=21.42+/-0.47 and IR source WISE J124850.79-412654.5 (W1=13.008+/-0.025, W2=12.515+/-0.025, W3=11.486+/-0.128, W4=8.933+/-0.324). Near-infrared color index (J-K) is also very large for cataclysmic variables: 14.23-13.25=1.0 (2MASS) and 14.40-13.14=1.26 (DENIS). The object has an X-ray counterpart in XMM-Newton and Chandra catalogs: 3XMM J124850.8-412653 (flux=5.96e-15 mW/m2) and CXO J124850.796-412654.17 which shows the flux variation by a factor of 12, from 9.8e-16 mW/m2 to 1.1e-14 mW/m2. The follow-up observations were performed remotely at the Chilescope Observatory in Chilean Andes near La Serena. 0.50-m f/3.6 Newtonian reflector with 4Kx4K FLI Proline CCD providing the 66'x66' field of view was used. A total of sixty-three 180-sec exposures in Luminance filter were obtained from 05:02 to 08:39 UT on 2018 March 11 with the short interruption from 06:45 to 07:04 UT. The light curve is presented <a href="" "">here</a>. The star 1.6' to the East of the variable was used as a reference star with V=16.046 in APASS DR9 (A. Henden et al., 2016). The variable shows no deep eclipses over 3.6 hours (unless it was missed during the 20-minute gap), suggesting the orbital period is larger than 4 hours. Otherwise the light curve is characterized by the short scale variability with a period about 0.0362(2)d, or 52.1 minute which can be interpreted as a rotation period of the white dwarf. The search for the possible period in Siding Spring Survey data is giving low significance peaks near 0.25357d (6.1 hr) and 0.23748d (5.7 hr). Based on the variability of X-ray counterpart and the complicated optical light curve with no stable pattern, Larin 2 is likely a magnetic cataclysmic variable star (polar) with a large IR contribution from the secondary and a long period. Photometric time series from multiple longitudes are needed to determine the orbital period of this variable star. Spectroscopy is also encouraged to verify the proposed classification as an intermediate polar. Color-combined DSS finder chart is uploaded to   (10'x10' FOV). Chilescope Observatory:  "

929,ATEL #11403,"This is reposted from GCN #22471 as it is of interest to the transient community. At 00:11:39 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and located MAXI J1820+070 (Kawamuro et al, 2018; ATel #11399) (trigger=813771, retriggering as trigger=813772). Swift slewed immediately to the location. The BAT on-board calculated location is RA, Dec 275.025, +7.192 which is RA(J2000) = 18h 20m 06s Dec(J2000) = +07d 11' 33"" with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including systematic uncertainty). Because of the of duration of this image trigger (17 minutes) no BAT lightcurve is immediately available. The XRT began observing the field at 00:31:42.2 UT, 1202.8 seconds after the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright X-ray source located at RA, Dec 275.0895, 7.1832 which is equivalent to: RA(J2000) = +18h 20m 21.48s Dec(J2000) = +07d 10' 59.5"" with an uncertainty of 5.3 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This location is 232 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position. This position is 33.1 arcseconds from that of a known X-ray source: 1RXS J182022.9+071125 in the ROSAT RASSFSC catalogue. Assuming a typical GRB power-law spectrum (NH=3e21 cm^-2, gamma=2), the catalogue entry for this object is equivalent to a 0.2-10 keV flux of 9.3e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1; the flux in the 2.5 s XRT image was 1.37e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1. No event data are yet available to determine the column density using X-ray spectroscopy. UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter starting 1212 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a 16.8 mag source at RA(J2000) = 18:20:21.25 = 275.08856 DEC(J2000) = 07:10:54.7 = 7.18186 with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.61 arc seconds. This position is 5.9 arc seconds from the center of the XRT position. No correction has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.23. The XRT and UVOT locations of the counterpart are near the location of ASASSN-18ey (distances=10.5 arcsec, 16 arcsec respectively), which was suggested as the counterpart to the MAXI source by Denisenko (ATel #11400)."
930,ATEL #11404,"In ATEL #11403 the UVOT counterpart reported was incorrect, and was in fact an unrelated star near the XRT position. In the UVOT prompt white image we detect a bright source, which has considerable brightening over archival images of the field, at the following coordinates, RA/Dec(J2000) = 75.09138, 7.1853, which is equivalent to: RA(J2000) = 18h 20m 21.93s, Dec(J2000) = +07d 11m 07.1s This source lies 0.36 arc-seconds from the source ASASSN-18el (ATEL #11400), and is therefore the same source. We note that the XRT position is 10.5 arc-seconds from the UVOT/ASASSN position, however, given the brightness of the XRT source, we believe it is the same object as MAXI J1820-070 and the associated ASASSN-18el. We apologize any confusion."

A crude spectral fit gives a power-law of slope 4.8+/-1.2 or black-body with kT=90+/-30 eV absorbed by the Galactic column. The absorbed flux for the black-body model is 4.6+/-1.5 E-12 ergs/s/cm2 with an unabsorbed flux of 1.2+/-0.4 E-11 ergs/s/cm2. This is at least a factor 15 higher than an upper limit from the ROSAT all-sky survey. The source position is RA:211.1955 DEC:-25.1931 with an error circle of 8 arcseconds (1-sigma). A follow-up by Swift-XRT on 28/2/2018 refined the coordinates to RA:211.1939 DEC: -25.1950 (error radius=3.6"", 90% confidence) consistent with the galaxy 2MASX 14044671-2511433, which appears to be a normal galaxy from its WISE colours. The Swift count rate was 0.087+/-0.006 c/s indicating a reduction in flux of a factor ~2, with a very soft spectrum of power-law of slope 6.0+/-0.3 or black-body with kT=70.3+/-6.0 eV.

935,ATEL #11386,"On March 1 at T0 = 07:34:19.76 (UTC), a Fast Radio Burst (FRB180301) was detected during Breakthrough Listen observations with the 21-cm multibeam receiver of the CSIRO Parkes radio telescope (see ATel #11376). FRB180301 occurred at an angle of 15.6 deg from the INTEGRAL pointing axis at the time of the event, only 0.5 deg from the edge of the IBIS/ISGRI Field of View (FoV). Unfortunately, at this orientation it is not possible to exploit direct coded-mask imaging with IBIS/ISGRI (nor with JEM-X). We searched the rates of the INTEGRAL ""all-sky detectors"" (see Savchenko et al. 2017, A&A 603, A46) for any impulsive transients at the time of the FRB. For the given FRB source location, the best sensitivity is achieved with IBIS/ISGRI or SPI-ACS, depending on the source spectrum. The background within +/-300 seconds around the event was very stable. We do not detect any significant counterparts. We estimate a 3-sigma upper limit on the 75-2000 keV fluence of 4.0e-7 erg/cm^2 for a burst lasting less than 1 s with a characteristic short GRB spectrum (an exponentially cut-off power-law with alpha=-0.5 and Ep=600 keV) occurring at any time in the interval within 300 s around T0. For a typical long GRB spectrum (Band function with alpha=-1, beta=-2.5, and Ep=300 keV), the derived fluence upper limit in 8 s is 1.1e-6 erg/cm^2 in the 75-2000 keV energy range. FRB180301 was in the FoV of IBIS/ISGRI in the pointings immediately before and after the event. This allows us to derive the following upper limits from these data: Before the event (UTC 2018-03-01 06:15:33 - 07:11:07): 20 - 40 keV : 290 mCrab or 2.2e-9 erg/cm2/s 40 - 80 keV : 453 mCrab or 3.3e-9 erg/cm2/s After the event (UTC 2018-03-01 08:11:03 - 09:06:37): 20 - 40 keV : 88 mCrab or 6.8e-10 erg/cm2/s 40 - 80 keV : 146 mCrab or 1.0e-9 erg/cm2/s INTEGRAL serendipitous upper limits on FRB180301:  "

The INTEGRAL observatory was taking data on a field centered at RA=87.04, Dec=19.32, 130 degrees from the approximate FRB arrival direction (RA=321.2 Dec=-33.8). This orientation is not very favorable for a detection of any gamma-ray transient with INTEGRAL all-sky detectors (see <a href="" "">Savchenko et al., 2017, A&A 603, A46</a> for details).

We inspected these data, which have a stable background within the hour around the FRB occurrence time, and derive an upper limit on any associated impulsive gamma-ray transient.

942,ATEL #11385,"The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (<a href="" "">Manchester et al. 2013</a>) project monitors pulse times of arrival for 24 millisecond pulsars in the Galaxy on a fortnightly cadence using the multibeam receiver on the CSIRO 64-m Parkes Telescope. During these observations we commensally search for fast radio bursts (FRBs) using the BPSR backend and Heimdall algorithm (<a href="" "">Barsdell et al. 2011</a>). We have now detected our second FRB during the commensal search since commencing in June 2017. <a href=” ”>Astronomer’s Telegram 11046</a> describes the discovery of our first burst and the same setup was used to discover the burst described below. On 2018-03-09 at 02:49:32.99 UTC (2018-03-09.1177429398), we detected a burst with a signal to noise ratio (S/N) of 411, at the dispersion measure (DM) of 263.47 pc cm^-3, in the field of the millisecond pulsar PSR J2124-3358 (DM = 4.60). The burst was detected in the centre beam of the receiver, which at the time was pointed at a position of (RA, DEC 21:24:43.8, -33:58:44.5). The burst width (full width at half maximum) was 0.576 ms and the early estimate of fluence is 12 Jy ms. We note that the location of the burst within the telescope beam is highly uncertain (> 0.25 deg) at the moment; consequently, the fluence measurement is biased low (<a href="" "">Macquart & Ekers 2017</a>). In this case the estimate of fluence is less reliable due to the dynamic range of recorded data not being sufficient and some samples overflowing (see plots). We will provide a better localisation in a separate telegram as soon as it becomes available. This position is approximately -45.44 degrees off of the galactic plane. The galactic contribution is estimated to be 44.69 pc cm^-3 from the NE2001 model (<a href="" "">Cordes & Lazio, 2001</a>) and 29.97 from the YWM16 model (<a href="" "">Yao et al. 2017</a>). Assuming the latter model and the host contribution to the DM of 100 pc cm<sup>-3</sup>, we estimate the redshift to be 0.187. No repetitions were seen during 64 minutes of a subsequent observation of the same field down to S/N limit of 10, nor during 31 minutes preceding the FRB 180309. Details of total amount of time on that field during the PPTA programme will be published elsewhere. We encourage prompt follow-up with available facilities. We note that the event occurred too close to the Sun for an immediate follow-up with the SWIFT satellite. We used the interface available at   to estimate the redshift.

943,ATEL #11382,Just after end of the invisibility period of Aql X-1 we had started photometrical observations of this object in R passband. All data were taken using by the CCD-photometer of 1-meter Zeiss-1000 telescope of Special Astrophysical Observatory of Rus.Ac.Sci. Despite on inconvenient observations conditions (object airmass was about 2.0) we have measured brightness of Aql X-1 within three nights in February-March on the twilight sky. As the atmospheric conditions were mediocre we observed it only in R-passband. Results of preliminary data reduction are presented in the table. We can conclude that this transient is passing now it's peak phase and probably should begin the fading stage. Relatively large errors are explaining by high background level and 3-4 arcsec. atmospheric seeing. More precise data are in preparation.

948,ATEL #11378,"The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of the two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, has observed an increasing gamma-ray flux from a source positionally consistent with the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) PKS 1004-217 (3FGL J1006.7-2159) with coordinates RA: 10h06m46.4136s, DEC: -21d59m20.410s, J2000 (Beasley et al. 2002, ApJS, 141, 13) and redshift z=0.331 (Hewitt & Burbidge 1989, ApJS, 69, 1). Preliminary analysis indicates that on 4 March 2018, this source was in a high-flux state with a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (0.84+/-0.08) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainties only). This value is about a factor of 19 greater than the average flux reported in the third Fermi LAT catalog (3FGL; Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23) and about twice as large as our last reported flare in ATel #10952. The corresponding photon spectral index of 2.33+/-0.07 is in the typical range for a Fermi blazar. On 4 March 2018, between 00:00:00 / 06:00:00 UTC, this source underwent a flare with a six-hour averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (1.2+/-0.3) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainties only) and a spectral index of 1.94+/-0.18. Within this time, the six-hour averaged gamma-ray flux was about a factor of 33 greater than the average flux reported in the 3FGL. Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring of this source will continue. This source is being added to the ""LAT Monitored Sources"" and consequently a preliminary estimation of the daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi-LAT will be publicly available ( ). In consideration of the ongoing activity of this source we strongly encourage multiwavelength observations. For this source the Fermi LAT contact person is Janeth Valverde (valverde@llr.in2p3.fr). The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.

This spectrum is consistent with a type IIn supernova at relatively early phase. The strong Na ID absorption (~4.2 angstrom) feature in the spectra indicates that it suffered significant reddening due to MW or host galaxy. Cross-correlation with a library of supernova spectra using the comparison tool SNID ((Blondin and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows that it matches with SN 1998s at t = -13 days."
950,ATEL #11377,"We report the detection of X-rays from Nova Mus 2018 with the Swift XRT instrument. We have been carrying out weekly monitoring of the nova with Swift since its discovery on 2018 Jan 15 (see ATel #11220), and observations up to 2018 Feb 24 yielded X-ray non-detections. In the most recent observation carried out on 2018 Feb 27 (net exposure time of 2460 seconds), 57 photons are detected within a 20 pixel radius circle centered on the position of the nova. After background subtraction and correcting for PSF losses, the resulting net count-rate in the 0.3-10 keV energy range is 0.032 +/- 0.004 cts/s. We extracted a spectrum of the nova and attempted to model it in Xspec as an absorbed thermal plasma (tbabs*apec), but no stable fit to the data was obtained. This is probably due to the low number of source counts. The majority of the detected photons have energies in the range 4-7 keV, indicating that the X-ray emitting region is highly absorbed (at least 5 x 10^22 cm^-2). This first X-ray detection coincides with a likely dust formation event, as indicated by the precipitous drop in optical brightness since 2018 Feb 20 (see the website linked in ATel #11298). Prompted by this recent reduction in optical brightness, we began obtaining UV grism spectroscopy of Nova Mus 2018 with the Swift UVOT instrument. Our first UV spectrum was taken on 2018 Feb 17 and our most recent on 2018 Feb 27. The UV spectrum shows a strong Mg II emission line, a weak C III 1909 line, and weak lines of He II. There are significant absorption features in the range 190-300 nm, most prominently at 210, 230, and 270 nm which become less deep between the first and second spectra. Similar features were seen during the dust minimum of V5668 Sgr. UVOT photometry was initially obtained from the readout streak (formed when sources are bright enough to saturate the detector) and most recently using aperture photometry. The uvw2 and uvm2 images show a steady decline until 2018 Feb 24 when the magnitudes (Vega) were uvw2 = 11.49 +/- 0.04, uvm2 = 11.97 +/- 0.04. On 2018 Feb 27 the nova had suddenly decreased to uvw2 = 13.37 +/- 0.04 and uvm2 = 13.53 +/- 0.04, similar to the large drop observed in the optical and also due to the formation of dust. Nova Mus has now been detected at every wavelength, from radio to gamma-rays (see ATels #11183, #11201, #11221, and #11296). We will continue to monitor the nova with Swift over the coming weeks; observations at other wavelengths are highly encouraged."

954,ATEL #11374,"We obtained an optical spectrum (range 350-900 nm) of DLT18i (=SN 2018yu, ATEL#11371), discovered by the D<40 Mpc (DLT40) supernova search, on UT Mar. 1.51 2018 with the 2.4 m telescope (+YFOSC) at the LiJiang Observatory of YNAO. The spectrum is consistent with a young type-Ia supernova at a few days before the maximum. Cross-correlation with a library of supernova spectra using the GELATO (Harutyunyan et al. 2008, A.Ap. 488, 383;  ) shows that 2018yu matches with SN 2003kf at 8 days before maximum light.

A notch at the redder winger of Si II 6355 might be contributed to the absorption of CII 6580 at a velocity about 14000 km/s.

The observation of J1658 was performed between 2018-02-20 18:21:45 UT and 2018-02-21 04:25:38 UT, covering 7 satellite orbits, for a total of 20 ks exposure. We analyzed the data from the LAXPC instrument, covering the energy range 3-80 keV (Antia et al. 2017 ApJS 231 10). Power density spectra show the presence of band-limited noise plus a strong (rms of ~16%) and sharp Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO), whose centroid frequency increased with time from ~1.6 to 2 Hz. The total 0.1-20 Hz fractional rms is ~34% over 3-80 keV. The presence of such a QPO indicates that the source was in the hard intermediate state during these observations. The power density spectrum combined from all three LAXPC cameras is shown at the link below. Spectral fitting was performed over the energy range of 4-60 keV for the cameras LAXPC10 and 20, with LAXPC30 excluded due to a suspected gas leak leading to loss of efficiency. The continuum spectra can be approximately described by an absorbed disk blackbody and cutoff power law. A systematic error of 4% was included while performing spectral fitting. We obtained an N(H) = 1.6(+/-0.2)x10^{23} cm^{-2} (consistent with a NuSTAR observation carried out ~4 days prior to ours; ATel #11321), an inner disk temperature of 1.4+/-0.1 keV, a power law photon index of 1.76+/-0.06 and a high-energy cutoff of 46+/-3 keV. We obtained a reduced Chi^2 = 0.82 for 292 degrees of freedom. All uncertainties are stated at a 1-sigma confidence level. The 3-80 keV unabsorbed flux was 3.6x10^{-9} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1}, corresponding to a luminosity of 3x10^{37} ergs s^{-1} at 8 kpc. The power law to disk flux ratio is ~8 over 3-80 keV.

956,ATEL #11376,"We report the detection of a fast radio burst (FRB) on UTC 2018 March 1 at 07:34:19.76, during Breakthrough Listen observations with the 21-cm multibeam receiver of the CSIRO Parkes radio telescope. The burst was detected in beam 03 of the receiver only, which was centered on J2000 coordinates RA 06:12:43.4, DEC +04:33:44.8, at a signal-to-noise ratio of ~16, peak flux density of ~0.5 Jy, dispersion measure (DM) of ~520 pc cm^-2, and burst width of ~3 ms, while observing over ~340 MHz of bandwidth centered around 1382 MHz. The spectrum appears to be positive, i.e. brighter at higher frequencies. The burst, FRB 180301, was detected during the Breakthrough Listen (BL) Galactic plane survey [Isaacson et. al., PASP, 129, 9, 2017]. BL is foremostly a search for technologically-capable life beyond Earth; however, a real-time search for FRBs runs in tandem, using the HI-Pulsar digital system [Keith et. al., MNRAS, 409, 2, 2010; Price et. al., JAI, 5, 4, 2016; Keane et al., MNRAS, 473, 116, 2018]. The burst has also been detected with the Breakthrough Listen digital backend using an independent search technique [Gajjar et al. 2017, ATel #10675]. After detection, calibration routines were run and follow-up observations continued for approximately 2 hours; no further bursts were found. The BL digital systems record voltage-level data products to disk [MacMahon et al. arXiv:1707.06024v2], and these data have been preserved. Additional analysis is ongoing. The Galactic contribution to the DM along this line of sight is around ~155 pc cm^-3 using the NE2001 electron density model for the Milky Way [Cordes & Lazio, arXiv:0207156v3, 2002], and 233 pc cm^-3 using the YMW16 model [Yao et al., ApJ, 835, 29, 2016]. Assuming a host Galaxy contribution of ~100 pc cm^-2, we estimate the redshift to be around ~0.2, for zero host contribution it is ~0.3. We encourage prompt multi-wavelength follow-up. Based on the half-power beam width of the receiver, the positional uncertainty is of the order of 14 arcminutes (radius). Additional information available here:  "
957,ATEL #11369,"We report the following spectroscopic classifications for the transients detected by the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN), i.e., ASASSN-18dv/SN 2017yj (ATel#11368) and ASASSN-18dm/SN 2017yc (ATel#11343). All the spectra were obtained on UT 2018 Feb.28.5 - Feb.28.7 with the 2.4-m telescope (+YFOSC) at Lijiang Observatory of Yunnan Observatories. Based on the spectral comparison tools SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) the classifications were given as: (1) The spectrum of ASASSN-18dv/SN 2017yj matches with the normal type Ia supernova SN 2007ca at t = +3 days relative to the maximum light. Given a redshift of 0.035 (from the SNID fit) for its host galaxy, an expansion velocity of about 10300 km/s can be deduced from the Si II 635.5 absorption minimum; (2) The spectrum of ASASSN-18dm/SN 2017yc matches with the normal type Ia supernova SN 1999ek at t = +3 days relative to the maximum light. Given a redshift of 0.035 (from the SNID fit) for its host galaxy, an expansion velocity of about 10000 km/s can be deduced from the Si II 635.5 absorption minimum."
958,ATEL #11370,"We obtained optical spectra (range 360-870 nm) of SN 2018yo (= SNhunt353), discovered by the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey Transient Survey and Nikolay Mishevskiy, on UT Feb.28.83 2018 with the 2.4m telescope (+YFOSC) at Lijiang Observatory of YNAO. The spectrum is consistent with that of a type IIP supernova at a few weeks after the maximum light. Cross-correlation with a library of supernova spectra using the ""Supernova Identification"" code (SNID; Blondin and Tonry 2007, Ap.J., 666, 1024) shows that it matches with SN 2006bp at t = +25 days from the maximum light. After correcting for a redshift of 0.0134 for its host galaxy UGC 7840, an expansion velocity of about 10000 km/s can be derived from the absorption minimum of Ha line."
959,ATEL #11363,"We obtained a spectrum of ASASSN-18dk/AT 2018xy (ATEL #11343) on 2018 February 26.9 UT with the RSS mounted on the South African Large Telescope (SALT) at the South African Astronomical Observatory, under the SALT Large Programme on transients (2016-2-LSP-001). Using Superfit (Howell et al. 2005, ApJ, 634, 1190) and SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024), we find reasonable fits to post-peak Type Ia supernovae at the redshift of the host galaxy (z~0.03; The 2MASS Redshift Survey via NED).

960,ATEL #11364,"We report on SALT high-resolution spectroscopy of nova ASASSN-18ds, which was discovered by Stanek et al. (2018; ATel #11348) on 2018 February 24.36 UT and was reported as a classical nova by Schmidtobreick et al. (2018; ATel #11360) on 2018 February 26.96 UT. Here we present a detailed description of the high-resolution spectroscopy. We obtained a 1200 s spectrum of this nova under the SALT Large Science Program on transients on 2018 February 27.08 (UTC; HJD 2458176.57), using the High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS; Crause et al. 2014, Proc. SPIE, 91476) mounted on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). Observations were taken in the LR mode of HRS, covering a spectral range of 3800-8900 &#8491; at a resolution of R = 14,000. The data were reduced with the SALT HRS MIDAS pipeline (Kniazev et al. 2016, MNRAS 459, 3068). The spectrum is dominated by narrow emission lines of H I, Fe II, O I, Ca II, Mg I, Mg II, and Si II (see below a full list of the line identification). The lines have P Cygni and rounded profiles, characteristics of optically thick ejecta. We measure a FWHM of ~550 &plusmn; 50 km/s for H&#945; and a FWHM of ~470 &plusmn; 50 km/s for H&#946;). The absorption components are blue-shifted by ~240 &plusmn; 30 km/s. The line profiles and their widths are consistent with the conclusion of Schmidtobreick et al. (2018; ATel #11360) that the nova is still rising to maximum. We expect that future spectroscopic follow-up show narrower lines with weaker or possibly no emission profiles, while the nova eruption approaches the visual maximum. We identify the interstellar Na I (D2) and (D1) absorption features. Their large equivalent width (EW D2 ~ 1.6&#8491; and EW D1 ~ 1.48&#8491;) indicates that the nova is highly reddened. This is consistent with its low Galactic latitude.

961,ATEL #11365,"Stanek et al. (ATel #11348) recently reported on the detection of a likely Galactic Nova in the Milky Way disk, confirmed by spectroscopic observations at ESO NTT and SALT telescopes (Schmidtobreick et al. 2018, ATel #11360; Aydi et al. 2018, ATel #11364, respectively). ASASSN-18ds is located at coordinates RA, DEC (J2000) = 17:03:47.509, -38:16:57.14, corresponding to l, b = 347.384, 1.925, within the area covered by the VVV Survey in the Galactic disk (vvvsurvey.org; Minniti et al. 2010, New Astronomy, 15, 433). Multiband near-IR VVV observations taken in 2010 show the presence of a source 1.3 arcsec away from the reported target position. During the 2010-2013 seasons VVV Ks-band observations of the likely progenitor of Nova ASASSN-18ds show no significant variation in brightness with mean_Ks=14.54+/-0.03, which is within the VVV photometric errors at these magnitudes. Other nearby sources found in the VVV data down to the limiting magnitude of Ks=18.1 mag in the field are more distant (about 4 arcs apart) from the reported target position. According to Schlafly et al. (2011, ApJ 737, 103S) the mean extinction for the region around the source position is A_V=7.38 mag, corresponding to A_K=0.87 mag, assuming the Cardelli et al. (1989, ApJ, 345, 245) extinction law. VVV coordinates and magnitudes for the likely progenitor of Nova ASASSN-18ds are listed below.

963,ATEL #11367,"Star, Variables Our team has led a large effort to observe the Classical Be star HD6226 since last August when the amateur spectroscopist Olivier Thizy discovered an outburst corresponding to an epoch where the star builds a decretion disk. The star was previously analyzed by <a href="" "">Bozic et al. (2004)</a> who found the star to have quasi-periodic outbursts. // We have collected over 200 spectra of the outburst that occurred in the time span of August-October 2017, and had successfully proposed to obtain ultraviolet spectra with the Hubble Space Telescope in order to constrain the fundamental parameters of this star, allowing us to build better models of the star+disk system. The UV spectra are scheduled for March 5, 2018 at 7:30-10:00 UT. In order to supplement these data, we obtained recent optical spectroscopy with the APO 3.5 m telescope and echelle spectrograph. Our data showed a large emission feature in the H-alpha profile indicating that the star began building a disk since the last observation in the <a href="" "">BeSS database</a> on 2018 January 24.// Followup spectroscopy was obtained at both the Clarkson University Reynolds Observatory and the University of Toledo's Ritter Observatory on February 27, 2018 UT. The spectra were taken within a few hours of each other with the 0.3 m telescope at Clarkson and an LHIRES III spectrograph equipped with a 1200 grooves/mm grating and with the 1 m telescope at Ritter Observatory with a 1200 grooves/mm grating on a fiber-fed spectrograph. The followup spectroscopy confirm the emission as well as show that the gas moved in the ~day since the APO data were taken. Further reductions are necessary to quantify the changes. // We request further observations of the optical spectrum to quantify this emission episode and disk for modeling purposes. Further, near-infrared observations would help to measure the free-free excess from the disk. Past observations have shown that the star varies in optical light during these outbursts, so optical photometry would be beneficial. //"

965,ATEL #11362,"ASASSN-18dw was discovered on UT 2018-02-25.14 at g~14.3 as a transient with an amplitude of more than four magnitudes by Stanek et al. (ATel#11359). An analysis of the available archive near-IR photometry is presented in an attempt to constrain the properties of the progenitor. A search in the Two Micron All Sky Syrvey (2MASS; Skrutskie et al. 2006 AJ 131, 1163) and The Deep Near Infrared Southern Sky Survey (DENIS; Epchtein et al. 1997 Msngr 87, 27) databases revealed source counterparts, which properties are summarized below: 2MASS</br> Epoch of observation (JD) = 2451206.5658</br> J = 15.686+/-0.073</br> H = 15.117+/-0.083</br> Ks = 14.902+/-0.140</br> </br> DENIS </br> Epoch of observation (JD) = 2451514.751759</br> I = 16.86+/-0.10</br> J = 15.72+/-0.20</br> In the case of 2MASS All-Sky Release Point Source Catalog the counterpart was located 0.16 arcseconds away from the position reported by Stanek et al. 2018 (ATel#11359) and the DENIS DR3 (September 2005) position is 0.12 arcseconds away. Looking at the J band magnitudes of the source, it is obvious that the source did not show significant variations in brightness between Jan. 28th 1999 and Dec. 2nd 1999. Unfortunately both surveys were conducted simultaneously (1997-2001 for 2MASS versus 1996-2001 for DENIS) and do not give the chance to establish longer variability baseline. Also taking into account that the source was detected only in the I and J bands of DENIS, it is not possible to apply the transformations of Carpenter 2001 (AJ 121, 2851). On the other hand, considering the stable J magnitudes it is possible to combine both datasets and compute colors that will set some limits on the nature of the progenitor. The Galactic Dust Reddening and Extinction service within IRSA gives the following values for the dust extinction in a 2 degrees region around the transient position A_I=0.444, A_J=0.212, A_H=0.135, A_Ks=0.091 and A_V=0.786 magnitudes for the Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011 (ApJ 737, 103) reddening maps. The corresponding colors, corrected for extinction are: (I-J)_0 = 0.946+/-0.124</br> (J-H)_0 = 0.492+/-0.111</br> (H-Ks)_0 = 0.171+/-0.163</br> Please note that only the errors of the photometry are taken into account when calculating the uncertainties of the colors. Taking into account the uncertainties, these colors are consistent with a main sequence star of K spectral class, according to the data presented by Pecaut & Mamajek 2013 (ApJS 208, 9). They are also consistent with the same spectral and luminosity class according to the data presented in Ducati et al. 2001 (ApJ 558, 309), although some systematic differences in the (I-J) color are present in this case. Only based on the colors, it is not possible to rule out that the progenitor of the outburst does not belong to the giant or supergiant luminosity class. In case of a K main sequence star, utilizing the data of Pecaut & Mamajek 2013 (ApJS 208, 9), a distance modulus between 9.8 and 10.1 could be estimated, which means that the object is located further than the the Orion star forming region. In the case of more luminous object (giant or supergiant), the distance will only increase. Although there is a significant number of heterogeneous photometric data points on the progenitor in different archives, follow up photometry and spectroscopy are crucial to better constrain the properties of the transient."
966,ATEL #11356,"We observed the new X-ray transient MAXI J1813-095 (ATels #11323, #11326, #11332) with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) between 2018-02-22 20:52 UT and 2018-02-23 02:59 UT. Our observations were taken simultaneously at 5.5 and 9 GHz, with a bandwidth of 2 GHz at each frequency. We used 1934-658 for flux calibration and 1819-096 for phase calibration. Data were reduced in CASA version 4.7.0 (McMullin et al 2007). Imaging was carried out using a rubustness of 0 and flux densities were measured by fitting for a point source in the image plane. Due to its compact configuration (750B), we did not include the isolated antenna 6 when imaging, leading to angular resolutions of 108"" x 7.31"" and 68.4"" x 4.63"" at 5.5 and 9 GHz, respectively, at a position angle of -177.8 degrees east of north. We significantly detect MAXI J1813-095 at the position (measured at 9 GHz):</br> RA (J2000): 18:13:34.073 +/- 0.014</br> Dec (J2000): -9:32:07.3 +/- 3.7</br> where the 1-sigma errors are the larger of the statistical error from the fitted position (Declination error) or the theoretical statistical error of centroiding (Beam/2*SNR; Right Ascension error). There may be larger systematic errors that we do not include. Using Galactic disk and bulge stellar populations (Juric et al 2008; McMillan 2011) and excluding the potential effect of any natal supernova kick, a source along this line of sight has a likely distance of 8^+6/-2 kpc (1 &sigma; confidence interval). We measure flux densities of 0.69 +/- 0.06 mJy and 0.47 +/- 0.04 mJy at 5.5 and 9 GHz, respectively, implying a radio spectral index of &alpha;= -0.7 +/- 0.2, where S<sub>&nu;</sub> &prop; nu<sup>&alpha;</sup>. Given this spectral index, the radio emission converts to a 5-GHz luminosity of 4*&pi;*&nu; f<sub>&nu;</sub> d<sup>2</sup> = (3.3 +/- 0.4)E29*(d/8kpc)<sup>2</sup> erg/s. Swift/XRT observed MAXI J1813-095 on 2018-02-21 (between 11:40:06 and 11:58:12 UT) and 2018-02-23 (22:25:00 to 22:44:00 UT), bracketing our radio observation. We extracted the data using the online XRT pipeline (Evans et al. 2009) and fit with an absorbed power-law model. On 2018-02-21 we find a best fit with an N_H of (9.6 +/- 0.2)E21<sup>2</sup> and a photon index of 1.45 +/- 0.07, providing an unabsorbed 1-10 keV X-ray flux of (7.8 +/- 0.2)E-10 erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to a 1-10 keV X-ray luminosity of (5.95 +/- 0.15)E36*(d/8kpc)<sup>2</sup> erg/s. On 2018-02-23, we find an N_H of (1.1 +/- 0.3)E21<sup>2</sup> and a photon index of 1.5 +/- 0.1, providing an unabsorbed 1-10 keV X-ray flux of (7.9 +/- 0.3)E-10 erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to a 1-10 keV X-ray luminosity of (6.05 +/- 0.15)E36*(d/8kpc)<sup>2</sup> erg/s. The X-ray luminosities and spectrum are consistent with the source being in the low-Eddington part of the hard state, typical of the early part of an outburst. This state is associated with a compact steady jet, as opposed to jet ejecta (which is associated with the transition between the hard and soft state at higher luminosities). Espinasse and Fender (2018) suggested that radio-quiet hard state black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) have steeper indices (&alpha;=-0.2+/-0.3) than radio-loud hard state BHXBs (&alpha;=0.2+/-0.2). We measure a spectral index that is consistent with the optically thin spectra expected from jet ejecta (&alpha;~-0.6), potentially consistent with compact jets in radio-quiet hard-state BHXBs, and inconsistent with compact jets in radio-loud hard-state BHXBs. Comparing the luminosities to those of hard-state XBs, MAXI J1813-095 is consistent with radio-quiet BHXBs and radio-loud neutron star XBs; however, we caution that this correlation would not apply to jet ejecta. Given the consistency of the X-ray properties, the radio spectral index and the radio/X-ray correlation with the properties of radio-quiet BHXBs, MAXI J1813-095 may be a radio-quiet BHXB. We thank Jamie Stevens and ATNF staff for making these observations possible."
967,ATEL #11357,"We observed the new transient MAXI J1813-095 (see ATels #11323, #11326, #11332, #11356) from 2018 February 23th 02:57 to 18:13 UTC with INTEGRAL in order to measure the intrinsic properties of the broad-band X-ray spectrum and to obtain more information about the nature of the source. We obtained an effective exposure of about 30ks in both JEM-X and ISGRI. We used the quick look analysis of the NRT data provided by the ISDC for our analysis and combined them with contemporaneous Swift/XRT observations taken later on the same day (ObsID 00010563003). We find that the spectrum between 0.5--200keV is well described by an absorbed power-law with an exponential cutoff at high energies. The best fit parameters are: absorption column N_H = 1.18^{+0.15}_{-0.14}e22 cm^-2, photon index Gamma = 1.57\pm0.10, and cutoff energy E_cut = 140^{+120}_{-50} keV (90% uncertainties). The spectral parameters agree well with the ones reported for the soft spectrum by Kennea et al. (ATel #11326). The measured column density is about a factor of two above the expected Galactic column of ~5e21cm^-2 (Dickey & Lockman, 1990). The unabsorbed flux between 2--100keV is 7.0\pm0.4e-10 erg/s/cm^2, which corresponds to a luminosity of ~5e36 erg/s at 8kpc (see Russell et al., ATel #11356). The improvement using a cutoff-powerlaw over a straight power law seems significant with a Delta Chi^2 of 14 for one more variable parameter, resulting in a chance improvement possibility of 0.2% according to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). However, we caution that the exact values and significance may change with the consolidated data. The spectral shape is consistent with the source being a new black-hole transient in a low/hard state, as typically seen during the beginning of an outburst. Further multi-wavelength observations are encouraged to follow-up and monitor MAXI J1813 during its current outburst. We thank the INTEGRAL project scientist, the ISOC, and the ISDC for the prompt processing and scheduling of our DDT observation and their support with the analysis."
968,ATEL #11358,"We report on optical observations of the field of Swift J1658.2-4242 with the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) 1-m robotic telescopes. The X-ray (ATel #11306, #11321) and radio (ATel #11322) properties of the source suggest this new transient could be a black hole X-ray binary (BHXB). The source was discovered by Swift BAT on 16 February 2018 (GCN #22416) and was also detected on 14 February 2018 by INTEGRAL (ATel #11306). Possible X-ray pulsations were reported at a frequency of ~0.115 Hz with Swift XRT (ATel #11311), however a follow-up NuSTAR observation detected a periodocity that increased in frequency from ~0.138 Hz to ~0.166 Hz, indicating that this is a QPO, commonly seen in BHXBs in the hard state. A flat radio spectrum observed with ATCA, and the position of the source on the radio - X-ray correlation, favour a BHXB at a distance of > 3 kpc (ATel #11322). There is an optical and infrared source in several catalogues consistent with the position of the radio and X-ray counterpart (ATel #11334, #11342). An optical spectrum of this object taken with the SOAR telescope (ATel #11342) is consistent with a mid to late K star, with foreground extinction E(B-V)=1.4+/-0.1 mag and no accretion signatures. It was unclear from the SOAR observation if the source had brightened from catalogue magnitudes. We observed the field of Swift J1658.2-4242 with the 1-m LCO network of telescopes (the nodes at Cerro Tololo, Chile and the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO), South Africa) on 22, 23, 24 and 25 February in the SDSS i' and r'-bands. We detect a single source at the radio position (see link to our finding chart below). The PSF of the object is consistent with being a point source (the seeing was 1.0"" in our best image on 22 Feb), and we detect no other sources close by (the nearest star is 8 arcsec away). Using several stars from the VPHAS+ DR2 survey (<a href="" "">Drew et al 2014, MNRAS, 440, 2036</a>) to calibrate the field, we report the following AB magnitudes for this source: 22 Feb (MJD 58171.3): i_{AB}=19.05 +- 0.06 23 Feb (MJD 58172.1): i_{AB}=19.07 +- 0.06 24 Feb (MJD 58173.3): i_{AB}=19.11 +- 0.07; r_{AB}=20.31 +- 0.11 25 Feb (MJD 58174.3): i_{AB}=19.09 +- 0.05; r_{AB}=20.05 +- 0.06 The VPHAS catalogued AB magnitudes are i_{AB}=19.02 +- 0.04; r_{AB}=20.20 +- 0.09. Our LCO magnitudes agree with the VPHAS values within errors, with no evidence for variability, except possibly a slight brightening in the r'-band filter, although this would need follow-up observations to confirm. All X-ray binaries brighten at optical wavelengths during outburst, so we conclude that this source is very likely to be a foreground line-of-sight star unrelated to the X-ray binary, as the SOAR spectrum also suggested (ATel #11342). However, we note that this chance alignment is surprising given the density of stars in our image (see link to our finding chart below). The total Galactic extinction in this direction is A_v~58.6 mag (ATel #11334), and the neutral hydrogen column measured from X-ray spectroscopy is NH ~ (1.3 - 1.9) x 10^{23} cm^{-2} (ATel #11307, #11310, #11321, #11336). Using the NH/A_v relation of <a href="" "">Zhu et al. (2017, MNRAS, 471, 3494)</a>, this NH corresponds to a dust extinction of A_v ~ 62 - 91 mag. It is therefore not surprising that we do not detect the optical counterpart. Deep infrared observations are encouraged (K-band or longer wavelengths) to attempt to detect the counterpart. The LCO observations are part of an on-going <a href="" "">monitoring campaign</a> of ~ 40 low-mass X-ray binaries (<a href="" "">Lewis et al. 2008</a>) with LCO and the Faulkes Telescopes.

The spectrum is dominated by the strong emission blend of Halpha and [NII]. In addition to the Balmer lines, strong FeII emission lines are present, blended with their respective blue-shifted absorption lines. We interpret the spectrum as that of an FeII-class nova during the pre-maximum phase. Unfortunately, the object is slightly saturated on the R acquisition image. Comparing with the brightest star in the field, USNO 0450.26357218, which is not saturated, we find that the nova is brighter than R=12.4mag during our observation.

Our most recent NIR photometry for this source shows that on December 29th,2017 (JD2458116.609456), the object brightness corresponded to H = 12.669 +/- 0.02. While, in a previous observation in this band (MJD2458063) the object had a magnitude H = 13.708 +/- 0.03. This particular flare turned out to be very red. The increment en the J band was only 0.7 mag, while in the H band was 1.0 mag and in the Ks band an increment of 1.45 mag was observed. Hence, the object has increased its luminosity by a factor of about 3.8 in K in this rather short lapse. This behavior is consistent with a fresh injection of relativistic electrons onto a magnetized zone.

The results of our observations are summarized in the following table: Civil Date (UT) Rmag dRmag 2017 Dec 28.91 R=12.76 0.01 2017 Dec 29.87 R=12.76 0.01 2018 Jan 02.75 R=13.19 0.01 2018 Feb 08.77 R=12.71 0.01 2018 Feb 09.89 R=12.92 0.01 2018 Feb 19.98 R=12.47 0.01 Observations for each available night consist of 4 x 300 s exposures in the Johnson-Cousins R filter, taken in 2x2 binning under good observing conditions with clear sky. Seeing ranged between 4.5"" and 5"" (FWHM). After dark current subtraction and flat field correction the images for each night were averaged and aperture photometry was performed on the average frame by means of the MaximDL software package. Reference and check stars in the field of view were taken from the finding chart made available by Landessternwarte Koenigstuhl at   . The reference R magnitudes for these stars are taken from Villata et al., A&AS 130, 305 (1998). Quoted uncertainty is statistical only. We will continue monitoring the source in the following nights. Multi-wavelength follow-up is encouraged. Any enquiry on these observations can be addressed either to Alessandro Marchini (alessandro.marchini@unisi.it) or to Giacomo Bonnoli (giacomo.bonnoli@unisi.it). The Astronomical Observatory of the University of Siena runs a remotely operated 0.3 m f/5.6 Maksutov-Cassegrain reflector, installed on a German equatorial mount. The instrument is hosted in a dome on the roof of the Department building, 0.7 km southwards of the city center (43 18 45 N 11 20 12 E). Site elevation is around 300 m above sea level. The telescope is equipped with a Johnson-Cousins BVRI filter wheel and a STL-6303 SBig CCD (3072 x 2048 9 micron pixels) capable of imaging a 58 x 38 square arcminutes field of view with a resolution of 2.3""/pixel (in binning 2x2)."
979,ATEL #11340,"We provide X-ray counterparts for the unidentified Swift/BAT sources listed in the 105 month catalogue (Oh et al. 2018, ApJS in press). These associations were found by cross-correlating the list of U1,U2 and U3 sources with the ROSAT Bright (RASSBSC, Voges et al. 1999, A&A, 349, 389) and the XMM-Newton Slew (XMMSlew, Saxton et al. 2008, A&A, 480, 611) catalogues. Using the method developed by Stephen et al. (2005, A&A, 432, L49), we find a strong correlation with 26 (RASSBSC, R in table) and 11 associations (XMMSlew, X) respectively with around one of these expected by chance alignment. Considering only U1 and U2 sources, we find 9 associations which are listed below where for each BAT source we report position and relative error of the X-ray counterpart, its distance from the BAT source position compared to the BAT 90% error radius, the catalogue used and information (redshift and class) on the optical counterpart. Optical identifications were found using the RASSBSC positional and the XMMSlew astrometric uncertainties. In 3 cases the X-ray counterpart is outside the 90% BAT error circle but inside the 99% positional uncertainty. We also retrieved and analysed the 6dFGS spectrum of 6dFGS J210322.1-214756 and 6dFGS J134043.6-281105 as well as the LAMOST spectrum of SWIFTJ0156.1+4463 but only in the last two cases were we able to classify the objects.

981,ATEL #11342,"Swift J1658.2-4242 is a new transient discovered by Swift (GCN #22416 and #22417). NuSTAR observation of this indicates presence of a broad iron line and quasi-periodic oscillations (ATel #11321) and Radio observations by ATCA show a strong radio counterpart with a flat radio spectral slope (ATel #11322). These all suggest Swift J1658.2-4242 is likely to be a black hole X-ray binary. Within the small (< 0.5"") error circle of the ATCA position, there is a single optical source in archival imaging. The published mean magnitudes of this source are r=20.07 and i=18.65, from VPHAS+ DR2 (Drew et al 2014, MNRAS, 440, 2036). We observed this source on UT 2018 Feb 22.4 with the Goodman Spectrograph on the SOAR telescope. We note that no new source beyond this archival source was present in acquisition images taken with a long-pass filter. This non-standard filter makes it challenging to determine whether the source has brightened compared to the archival data. Comparison with field stars suggests that any such brightening is < 1.5 mag, but a smaller change in its magnitude is not ruled out. Our 1200-sec SOAR spectrum, covering the region of 4800 to 8800 A, is consistent with a normal mid to late K star, with an approximate Teff of 4000 to 4600 K. The most prominent absorption lines are those of the Ca triplet, and given a barycentric radial velocity of about -20 km/s. We see no evidence for H or He emission in any lines covered by our spectrum, nor evidence of a disk-like continuum. The reddening estimated from an SED fit to the spectrum is E(B-V)=1.4+/-0.1 mag. We separately considered archival H and K photometry for this optical source as observed in the VVV survey DR2 (Minniti et al 2010, New Ast, 15, 433). Comparing these magnitudes to Padova solar metallicity isochrones for an age of 10 Gyr, the H-K vs. K color-magnitude diagram suggests E(B-V) = 1.3 for an assumed distance of 8 kpc and E(B-V) = 1.4 for a distance of 3 kpc (the minimum distance indicated by the radio/X-ray emission; ATel #11322). The resulting absolute magnitude of the optical source would imply classification as a red giant for any distance > 4 kpc; at 3 kpc the source could also be a subgiant. Hence, if this source is the counterpart to the X-ray binary, it is likely to be an evolved star. However, the absence of accretion signatures in the spectrum, and the lack of evidence for a brighter optical counterpart, suggest that this optical source may well not be the counterpart to Swift J1658.2-4242. Deeper imaging could help determine whether there is another possible counterpart to the X-ray source."

987,ATEL #11331,"We report on NIR photometry of the radio source GB6J0713+5738, tentatively identified with the Gamma-ray source Fermi J0713+5739 (ATels #10149, #11056). On January 22nd, 2018, we observed a source coincident with the radio source coordinates, finding that on MJD2458140.8592, its fluxes corresponded to J = 16.448 +/- 0.07, H = 15.865 +/- 0.02 and Ks = 14.931 +/- 0.05. Those NIR colors are typical of blazars. Furthermore, the source was not detected in the 2mass NIR survey, this fact implies that at the time of the survey the source had H > 17.5. Hence, this source has increased its NIR flux by a factor of about 10 in this lapse and it is presently undergoing an important NIR flare event. This activity strongly suggests that the counterpart of the source Fermi J0713+5739 is indeed the radio source GB6J0713+5738. Our observations are carried out with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo Haro Observatory operated by the National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (Mexico), equipped with the instrument CANICA a NIR camera.

Observations were obtained on February 22nd 09:18 UT with integrations of ~8.3min in the optical bands and ~10.7min in the NIR bands. Two sources are detected within the Swift/XRT error circle (Kennea et al. 2018, ATel #11326), both also included in PanSTARRS DR1 ( ). The GROND positions are: Source A = PSO J181334.004-093159.456 RA(J2000) = 18:13:34.015 Dec(J2000) = -09:31:59.20 Source B = PSO J181333.964-093158.045 RA(J2000) = 18:13:33.970 Dec(J2000) = 09:31:57.94 with uncertainties of 0.05"" and 0.07"" in RA and Dec, respectively.

We report the results from a preliminary data analysis of these data. Swift J1658.2-4242 is detected in the IBIS/ISGRI mosaic (based on data from 2018 February 20 at 14:04 to February 22 at 02:22, UTC; exposure time 125 ks) at a significance of 121 sigma in the 20-40 keV energy range and about 46 sigma in the 40-80 keV energy range. The corresponding fluxes estimated from the IBIS/ISGRI mosaics are 100+/-1 mCrab and 67+/-1 mCrab, respectively. Swift J1658.2-4242 is also detected in the JEM-X mosaics (same observations used for the ISGRI mosaics, see above) at a significance of 59 sigma in the 3-10 keV energy range and about 37 sigma in the 10-20 keV energy range. The corresponding fluxes calculated from the JEM-X mosaics are 100+/-2 mCrab and 115+/-3 mCrab, respectively. We measured the fluxes of Swift J1658.2-4242 in mCrab, using the most recently available calibration observation of the Crab carried out during the satellite revolution 1921 (from 2018 February 17 at 22:39 to 2018 February 18 at 11:59, UTC). The average JEM-X + ISGRI spectrum (3-100 keV) can be reasonably well described (chi2_red=1.5, 24 d.o.f.) by an absorbed power law with photon index 2.61+/-0.04 (we fixed the absorption column density at N_H=1.3E23 cm^-2, as previously reported in the ATel #11321). Uncertainties are given at 68% c.l. The estimated flux from the spectral fit is about 3.6E-9 ergs/cm^2/s in the energy range 3 - 100 keV.

992,ATEL #11335,"In ATel#11331, we reported the NIR detection of the radio source GB60713+5738 and the suggestion of it being in flaring state. However, we found a previous observation in our archive that fully confirms a recent giant flare of this object. On December 29th, 2017 (MJD2458116.972963), we observed the source with NIR fluxes J = 15.642 +/- 0.04, H = 14.807 +/- 0.02, Ks = 14.931 +/- 0.05. In January 22nd,2018, the source had declined to our flux values reported on ATel#11331, ie. the source had fainted by a factor of 3 in one month. This fact is consistent with the renew gamma-ray activity of Fermi J0713+5739 (ATel#11056) and provides further evidence for the radio and the NIR sources being the counterparts of the gamma-ray one. Our observations are carried out with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo Haro Observatory operated by the National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (Mexico), equipped with the instrument CANICA a NIR camera.

993,ATEL #11334,"The X-ray transient Swift J1658.2-4242 was detected on 18.02.18UT with initial coordinates RA=16h58m11s and Dec=-42d42'31"" with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (GCN #22416). (All coordinates in this contribution are in equinox J2000.) The subsequent analysis of the XRT/UVOT data resulted in more precise coordinates RA=16h58m12.64s and Dec=-42d41'54.5'', with error radius 1.6'' at 90% confidence (ATel #11307). Within the error circle two known sources were encountered VVV J16581262-42415478 and GLIMPSE G343.2514+00.0537 (ATel #11310). The ATCA radio observations of the transient (ATel #11322) yield RA=16h58m12.700+/-0.004, Dec=-42d41'56.09+/-0.25 (statistical errors only). Both positions agree within the uncertainty of the measurements, but the reported counterparts are outside of the error circle of the radio position. A dedicated search around the new reported position resulted in the detection of a counterpart in three catalogs: 2MASS J16581268-4241563 (located 0.33"" away, but consistent within the positional uncertainty of the 2MASS PSC), VVV J165812.68-424156.25 (0.21"" away) and GAIA 5966232529369270784 (0.25"" away). The 2MASS magnitudes of the source are J=16.038+/-0.106, H=15.116, Ks=15.055 with photometry flags AUU, which means that H and Ks magnitudes are reported as upper limits. The VVV source have magnitudes J=16.046+/-0.012, H=15.381+/-0.016, Ks=14.996+/-0.027. Taking into account the J band data in the epoch of 2MASS and VVV, along with the H and Ks magnitudes it is obvious that there are no significant changes in the near-IR flux of the source. The GAIA DR1 magnitude of 5966232529369270784 is 19.604. According to the Schlafly&Finkbeiner 2011 reddening maps, the extinction in the V band is 58.6 magnitudes, corresponding to Aj=15.7, Ah=9.98, Ak=6.7 magnitudes. Applying these will result in unreasonably blue near-IR colors. Obviously the extinction estimates are unreliable due to the proximity of the position to the Galactic plane. Based on the near-IR colors from the VVV data (without extinction correction): J-Ks=1.05+/-0.03, J-H=0.67+/-0.02, H-Ks=0.38+/-0.03, the source could be identified as a M6-M8 main sequence or giant star (Pecaut&Mamajek 2013, Ducati ey al. 2001). If we consider a main sequence star, the resulting V band magnitude will be in the order of 23. If a M6III object is considered, the resulting V~20 mag is broadly consistent with the G band magnitude reported by Gaia. (Note that the Gaia G band is fully encompassing the widely used V band filter.) Based on the reported characteristics of the counterparts, the uncertainty of the available extinction estimates and the interesting nature of the transient further optical and near-IR follow-up observations are strongly encouraged."
994,ATEL #11327,"Monitoring with the Gehrels Swift observatory's X-Ray Telescope detected an X-ray flux increase from the magnetar 1E 1048.1-5937 in January 2018 (Archibald et al., ATEL #11241). The Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER; Gendreau et al. 2012, SPIE Conference Series, Vol. 8443) performed two follow-up X-ray observations on January 30 (ObsID 1020240126) and February 6 (ObsID 1020240127), 2018, with exposures of 728 and 2520 seconds, respectively. The recently acquired 0.7-8.0 keV NICER spectra were fit jointly with earlier data, including an 8.9 ks NICER dataset from late July and early August 2017, as well as an XMM-Newton EPIC-pn 0.3-8.0 keV observation from December 28, 2000 (ObsID 0112780401; Tiengo et al. 2002, A&A 383, 182). The spectra are successfully modeled (chi2/d.o.f. = 1.052 at 1079 d.o.f.) by a blackbody plus a power-law component, with independent parameters at each epoch, attenuated by interstellar absorption ('phabs' in XSPEC, Anders & Grevesse 1989 abundance), with the absorbing column-density linked across all datasets. We confirmed the increase in flux, to (2.2-2.3)E-11 erg/s/cm2 (absorbed) in the 0.5-10 keV band, during the last two NICER observations. Preliminary best-fit blackbody temperatures are 0.64-0.69 keV, with column density NH = (0.85+/-0.06)E22 cm-2 (1-sigma statistical uncertainty) and power-law photon index 2.2-3.9. In each observation, typical statistical uncertainties of the spectral parameters are at the level of a few percent. The NICER observations of July-August 2017 show that, compared to its quiescent level in 2000, the source was already in a higher flux state, by almost a factor of three. In 2018, the flux increased further so that the source was approximately four times brighter than in quiescence. In contrast to conclusions drawn from past brightening episodes, where the dominant spectral change was found (Tam et al. 2008, ApJ 677, 573) to be in the power-law component, the derived 2018 spectral parameters suggest that this activation is mainly due to an increase in the blackbody emitting radius, which changed from ~1.6 km to ~3.4 km assuming a distance of 9 kpc (Durant & van Kerkwijk 2006, ApJ, 650, 1070). In the 0.7-8.0 keV range, we also computed the pulsed fraction [defined as PF = (max - min)/(max + min) of the pulse profile folded with period 6.4629755 s] for the last NICER observation on February 6, 2018, and found PF ~48%, significantly lower than the 81% measured in the December 2000 XMM-Newton observation. A similar anticorrelation between flux and pulsed fraction has been reported several times for this source (Tiengo et al. 2005, A&A 437, 997; Gavriil et al. 2006, ApJ 641, 418; Tam et al. 2008, ApJ 677, 573; Dib, Kaspi, & Gavriil 2009, ApJ 702, 614). These results are in agreement with the findings of Guver et al. (2015; ApJ 801, 48), where the authors modeled pulse profiles for this source using neutron star atmosphere models and inferred that the size of the hot spot changed from 80 degrees to 30 degrees from an outburst state in 2007 to quiescence in 2011. Such a change in the spot size was also suggested by Tam et al. (2008, ApJ 677, 573) as a reason for the observed anticorrelation between flux and pulsed fraction. This work was supported by NASA through the NICER mission and the Astrophysics Explorers Program.

We performed a 7-point tiling observation in order to cover the MAXI error region, with an exposure of 500s per tile. In the central tile we find a bright uncatalogued X-ray source at the following coordinates: RA/Dec (J2000) = 273.39169, -9.53307, which is equivalent to: RA(J2000) = 18h 13m 34.0s, Dec(J2000) = -09h 31m 59.0 with an estimated uncertainty of 2.2 arc-seconds radius (90% containment). This position is not consistent with the location of any previously know X-ray transient, and therefore we conclude that this is a new transient X-ray source, MAXI J1813-095. The XRT Photon Counting mode spectrum is well fit by an absorbed power-law model, with a photon index of 1.45 +/- 0.23 and absorption column N<sub>H</sub> = 1.3 +/- 0.3 x 10<sup>22</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>.

The average location of these on-board detections is RA, Dec = 273.355, -9.478 which is RA(J2000) = 18h 13m 25s, Dec(J2000) = -9d 28' 42”, with an uncertainty of 3 arc-minutes (radius, 90% containment, including systematic uncertainty).

1001,ATEL #11321,"We report on the initial analysis of a NuSTAR observation of the new X-ray transient Swift J1658.2-4242 (GCN #22416, #22417, #22419; ATEL #11306, #11307, #11310, #11311, #11318). NuSTAR observed Swift J1658.2-4242 from 2018-02-16T23:26:09 to 2018-02-17T20:51:09 with a total exposure of 33.3 ks. The time-averaged net count rates are 34.5+/-0.03 cts/s and 32.3+/-0.03 cts/s for FPMA and FPMB, respectively (~65 mCrab in the NuSTAR band). The continuum spectra measured by NuSTAR can be approximately described by an absorbed cutoff power-law model with NH = 1.3 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}, photon index of 1.3 and cut-off energy at 53 keV. A disk reflection component with a broad iron line is also required for a proper fit. Two strong dips are found in the NuSTAR light curve separated by ~30ks, indicating this source could be an eclipsing system. A peak is clearly detected in the NuSTAR power spectra, with a frequency that increases from 0.138+/-0.002 Hz to 0.166+/-0.003 Hz from the first half to the second half of the observation (excluding the dips), with FWHM of 3.5e-2+/-6e-3 Hz and 5.0e-2+/-8e-3 Hz, respectively. The features in the power spectrum are similar to QPOs detected in the hard state of accreting black holes. And there is no clear indication for pulsations in the NuSTAR data. Therefore we propose that Swift J1658.2-4242 is a black hole binary."
1002,ATEL #11322,"Swift J1658.2-4242 is a recently detected X-ray transient (GCN #22416, #22417, ATel #11306). This source has been identified as a potential neutron star Be/X-ray binary (ATel #11311) or black hole X-ray binary (ATels #11306, #11321). We observed Swift J1658.2-4242 with the Australia Compact Telescope Array (ATCA) between 2018-02-17 19:48:29.9 UT and 2018-02-18 02:29:09.9 UT (MJD 58166.96 +/- 0.14). The observations were taken at four frequencies, 5.5GHz, 9GHz, 17GHz, and 19GHz, with a bandwidth of 2 GHz at each frequency. We used 1934-638 for primary flux calibration, and the nearby calibrator 1714-397 (4.65 degrees away) for phase calibration. The data were reduced and imaged using standard routines in CASA (McMullin et al. 2007). We used a Briggs weighting robustness of 0 to balance sensitivity with resolution, and minimise effects from diffuse emission within the field. The array was in its 750B configuration. We did not include the isolated antenna 6 during imaging. We significantly detected a radio source at a position consistent with the Swift X-ray and UVOT position (ATels #11307, #11310). Our best radio position (measured at 19GHz) is: RA (J2000) = 16:58:12.700 +/- 0.004, Dec (J2000) = -42:41:56.09 +/- 0.25 (statistical errors only). When fitting a point source in the image plane the measured flux densities were: Frequency (GHz) | Beam Size (arcsec) | Flux Density (mJy)<br/> 5.5 | 16.9 x 8.3 | 2.35 +/- 0.17 <br/> 9.0 | 10.5 x 5.2 | 2.17 +/- 0.15 <br/> 17.0 | 8.0 x 2.5 | 2.27 +/- 0.09 <br/> 19.0 | 7.2 x 2.2 | 2.30 +/- 0.15 The radio spectral index of alpha = 0.00 +/- 0.07 (where S_nu &prop; nu<sup>alpha</sup>) is consistent with a flat radio spectrum from a compact jet. The radio emission provides a 5-GHz radio luminosity of (8.8 +/- 0.7)*1e29*(d/8kpc)<sup>2</sup> erg/s. Based on the Galactic disk and bulge stellar populations (Juric et al 2008; McMillan 2011), a source along this line of sight has a distance of 9.0 +7.0/-1.5 kpc (1 sigma confidence interval); adding in a Galactic halo component would increase the likely distance. Swift/XRT observations of the were taken a few hours earlier (between 2018-02-17 10:38:02 UT and 2018-02-17 16:43:58 UT; MJD 58166.57 +/- 0.13). We extracted the X-ray data using the online XRT pipeline (Evans et al. 2009). The X-ray data were fit with a highly-absorbed powerlaw model, with an N_H of (1.9 +/- 0.2)E23 cm<sup>-2</sup> and a photon index of 1.6 +/- 0.1, providing an unabsorbed 1-10 keV X-ray flux of (1.7 +/- 0.2)E-09 erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup>. This X-ray flux corresponds to an X-ray luminosity of (1.30 +/- 0.15)*1e37*(d/8kpc)<sup>2</sup> erg/s. At distances greater than 3kpc, the observed radio and X-ray luminosities of Swift J1658.2-4242 are consistent with a black hole X-ray binary on the radio-quiet branch of the L_r/L_x correlation (above all known neutron star X-ray binaries; see e.g., Tetarenko at al. 2016). Therefore, if the source is more distant than 3kpc, the strength of the radio emission indicates that Swift J1658.2-4242 is likely to be a black hole X-ray binary. However, at closer distances, it could be consistent with a neutron star X-ray binary. We note that there is only a 0.35% probability that Swift J1658.2-4242 is this close given our Galactic structure calculations along this line of sight."
1003,ATEL #11318,"INTEGRAL continued its observations of the new X-ray transient Swift J1658.2-4242 (GCN #22416 and #22417). The source was originally interpreted as a black hole X-ray binary due to its spectral shape (ATel #11306) but the detection of a pulsation with Swift (ATel #11311) points towards an accreting X-ray pulsar interpretation. Previous INTEGRAL observations of the source (ATel #11306) indicated a possible decrease in X-ray flux above 20 keV. The source was at the edge of the IBIS field of view and could thus not be reliably analyzed during the Galactic Bulge Monitoring campaign (PI Kuulkers) from 2018-02-16 13:03:15 to 2018-02-16 16:44:50 during INTEGRAL revolution 1920, i.e., directly following the previous detections. From 2018-02-16 17:00:39 to 2018-02-17 07:42:29 during the Galactic Center monitoring programme (PI Wilms) in INTEGRAL revolution 1920, we detect the source at: 15.3\pm0.7 cps or 153 mCrab in 20-40 keV band</br> 7.1\pm0.6 cps or 130 mCrab in 40-80 keV band We use source position for Swift J1658.2-4242 as reported in ATel #11310. We further use the newest observations of the Crab taken during revolution 1921 (2018-02-17/18) as reference values to convert detected counts to Crab values. The source thus appears to have brightened and slightly softened above 20 keV. However, we caution that inconsistent Crab conversions may be the reason for some or even most of the difference in reported flux values. On timescales of individual INTEGRAL science windows (~30 min), the source shows a flux variability of 20-30% in the 20-40 keV band. Currently next INTEGRAL observations of the Galactic center region are scheduled for 2018-02-20-22. We encourage further observations of this source with other instruments, especially simultaneous to upcoming INTEGRAL Galactic Center monitoring observations."

Classification spectrum was obtained on on 2018-01-16 using NTT/EFOSC2 (ePESSTO, ATel #11192). Its quality did not allow for precise classification and redshift estimation. The spectrum was in fair agreement with strongly reddened Type I SNe. SNID found matches with various SNe type I at z~0.01 to 0.04 (ATEL #11192). We obtained an additional spectrum of OGLE18be on 2018-02-01 using the FOcal Reducer/low dispersion Spectrograph 2 (FORS2) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The spectrum contains mostly the light from the host galaxy and reminds a Luminous Red Galaxy with apparent absorption line Ca II H & K, Hbeta and HeI at redshift z=0.151. The VLT/FORS spectrum was used to remove the host contribution from the earlier NTT/EFOSC2 spectrum. The spectroscopic classification on the differential spectrum with SNID code (Blondin & Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) showed the transient was consistent with SN Type Ia at maximum, in good agreement with OGLE I-band light curve shape.

1009,ATEL #11317,"We report on behalf of the Swift/XRT Deep Galactic Plane Survey Team: We observed the INTEGRAL error region of the X-ray transient source AX J1620.1-5002 (ATEL# 11252; Lepingwell et al.) for 1 ks with Swift/XRT to constrain its location. At the reported location of AX J1620.1-5002 we determine a 3-sigma upper limit of 4.2E-02 counts/s. We detected only one source, MAXI J1621-501, in the 24' XRT field of view with over 3 sigma significance above the background (0.3-10 keV). The source count rate was high, ~2.2 counts/s, so the fluxes reported below have been corrected for pileup. The source spectrum (0.5-10 keV) is well fit both with an absorbed powerlaw or an absorbed disk blackbody continuum. For the disk blackbody we get an unabsorbed flux of 7.4 +/- 0.2 E-10 erg/s/cm^2 corresponding to a luminosity L = 6.2 +/- 1.5 E36 erg/s at the reported distance of 8.4 +/- 2 kpc (Chenevez et al., ATel 11272). The blackbody temperature is T_in=3.6 +/- 0.4 keV and the N_H is frozen at 3.7 E22 cm^-2, as derived by our combined analysis (Gorgone et al., in preparation) of NuSTAR and XRT data (Cstat = 168.75 for 206 degrees of freedom). For the powerlaw we get Cstat = 180.26 with 206 dof, with N_H frozen at 3.7E22 cm^-2, and gamma=1.12 +/- 0.08; the unabsorbed flux is 8.2E-10 +/- 0.2 erg/s/cm^2 and the luminosity is L = 8.2 +/- 1.7 E36 erg/s. Our analysis supports the conclusion by Chenevez et al. (ATEL# 11272), that the source is most likely MAXI J1621-501 and not AX J1620.1-5002 or some other source in the field."

Deeper TOO observations are encouraged in order to confirm the presence of this period."
1014,ATEL #11312,"Transient We report on NIR photometry of the flat spectrum radio source PKS1244-255, cross identified with the intermediate redshift quasar CGRaBSJ1246-2547 (z=0.633) and the Gamma-ray source 3FGL1246.7-2547, We observed the source in the NIR, finding that on January 27th, 2017 (MJD 2458145.970579) its fluxes corresponded to J = 13.895 +/- 0.03, H = 12.937 +/- 0.02 and Ks = 12.042 +/- 0.04. Hence, the flux in Ks is a factor of 3.2 times brighter than the value previously determined by us on MJD 2457830.87; Ks = 13.296 +/- 0.04. The source is brightest since the time we started monitoring it on MJD 2454857. Our observations are carried out with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo Haro Observatory operated by the National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (Mexico), equipped with the instrument CANICA a NIR camera.

1015,ATEL #11310,"Using the data set from the recent telemetry downlink, we report further analysis of the new Galactic transient, Swift J1658.2-4242 (trigger #810300) (Barthelmy et al., GCN Circ. 22416). Using the BAT data from T+210 to T+963 sec, the BAT ground-calculated position is RA, Dec = 254.537, -42.712 deg which is RA(J2000) = 16h 58m 08.8s Dec(J2000) = -42d 42' 42.1"" with an uncertainty of 3.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment). The partial coding was 78%. The BAT mask-weighted light curve shows a continuous weak emission that starts before and ends after the event data range from T+210 s to T+963 s. Data from the BAT transient monitor (Krimm et al. 2013) show the source starts flaring around Feb. 14, 2018, and has reached a brightness of ~ 70 mCrab (15-50 keV). This is generally consistent with the detections reported by INTEGRAL (Grebenev et al., ATEL 11306). The BAT time-averaged spectrum from T+210.00 to T+963.02 sec is best fit by a simple power-law model. The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 1.98 +- 0.28. The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.2 +- 0.4 x 10<sup>-6</sup> erg/cm<sup>2</sup>. All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level. Swift/XRT began observation of the transient at 06:54 UT and observed the target in a mixture of Windowed Timing and Photon Counting mode for a total of 3.1 ks. In XRT data we localize the transient, utilizing UVOT to reduce the systematics on astrometry, to the following coordinates: RA/Dec(J2000) = 254.55266, -42.69845, which is equivalent to: RA(J2000) = 16h 58m 12.64s, Dec(J2000) = -42d 41m 54.4s, with an estimated uncertainty of 1.6 arc-seconds radius (90% confidence). We note that this position lies 0.4 arc-seconds from the IR source VVV J165812.62-424154.78, from the VISTA Variables DR2 catalog (Minniti et al., 2017), which has magnitudes H=16.2 and K=15.252. In addition G343.2514+00.0537, a source in the GLIMPSE catalog, is also consistent with the XRT localization. Spectral fits to the PC and WT data are consistent, although as WT data are unaffected by pile-up we report that fit here. The spectrum is well fit by a highly absorbed power-law model, with N<sub>H</sub> = 1.9 +/- 0.5 10<sup>23</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>, and photon index = 1.7 +/- 0.5. The average flux, corrected for absorption, is ~1.6 x 10<sup>-9</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (0.3 - 10 keV). The light-curve shows some evidence of fading during the observed period, although planned later observations of the new transient will be required to determine any fading. We find no evidence of pulsations or QPOs in the XRT data, although as the data are mainly taken in PC mode and suffer from pile-up, this does not place strong constraints on the presence of any periodicities in the data.

1016,ATEL #11307,"A follow-up pointing observation (ObsId:00810300991, 2.8 ks) of the recently discovered X-ray transient Swift J1658.2-4242 (GCN #22416, #22417) has been performed by Swift-XRT on MJD 58165.3 in PC mode. It allowed us to improve the source position using UVOT data to reduce the systematic errors in telescope pointing (see Goad et al. A&A, 476, 1401, 2007; Evans et al. MNRAS, 397, 1177, 2009): R.A. = 254.55268, Dec. = -42.69847 (=16h 58m 12.64s, -42o 41' 54.5'', epoch 2000.0). The error radius is 1.6'' at 90% confidence. There is a known infrared source VVV J165812.62-424154.78 with Ks magnitude of 15.25 located only 0.4'' off this position. The spectrum measured with XRT can be described by a strongly absorbed power-law with a photon index of 1.2+/-0.3 and NH = 1.5 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}. The source flux was about 7.2 (+/-0.6) x 10^{-10} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} in the 0.3-10 keV band that corresponds to the unabsorbed luminosity 1.8 x 10^{37} erg/s at an assumed distance of 10 kpc. The hardness of the spectrum is consistent with that based on INTEGRAL data (ATEL #11306). This work made use of data supplied by the UK Swift Science Data Centre at the University of Leicester."
1017,ATEL #11306,"During the on-going INTEGRAL observations of the Galactic center field performed from 2018 February 13 at 08:06 to February 16 at 13:01 (UTC) IBIS/ISGRI instrument on board INTEGRAL detected the new X-ray transient Swift J1658.2-4242 (GCN #22416 and #22417). Due to the large off-axis angle of Swift J1658.2-4242 with respect to the INTEGRAL pointing direction, the source was only sporadically within the IBIS/ISGRI field of view. Its 20-60 keV flux measured at different epochs was: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time (MJD) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Flux (20-60 keV) 58162.47 - 58162.67 | <17 (1 sigma) 58162.93 - 58163.14 | 10+/-8 mCrab 58163.31 - 58163.52 | 32+/-5 mCrab 58164.39 - 58164.56 | 99+/-9 mCrab 58164.81 - 58164.89 | 89+/-21 mCrab 58165.29 - 58165.41 | 41+/-24 mCrab During the fourth interval (MJD 58164.39-58164.56), we measured the highest fluxes in two energy bands: 84+/-6 mCrab (20-40 keV) and 97+/-9 mCrab (40-80 keV). This indicates that the source spectrum had a hardness compatible with the one of the Crab Nebula (photon index 2.1) or slightly harder, as typical of black-hole binaries in the hard state. While measured with large errors the last points in the table let us to suggest that the hard flux has stabilized or even begins to decrease. This may be a result of the source transition to another spectral state or the beginning of its complete switch-off. The source was always outside the INTEGRAL/JEM-X field-of-view, thus preventing us from verifying this hypothesis through simultaneous flux measurements in the softer X-ray band. Further observations of the source in the soft and hard X-rays, as well as in other energy domains, are encouraged."
1018,ATEL #11302,"The MAXI/GSC nova alert system triggered a bright X-ray transient source at 00:09:17.00 UT on 2018 February 2. The position of the source was consistent with LMXB 4U 1543-624. The X-ray flux averaged over the scan was 938 +- 61 mCrab (4.0-10.0keV, 1 sigma error). There was no significant excess flux in the previous transit at February 1 22:36 UT and in the next transit at February 2 1:42 UT with an upper limit of 20 mCrab for each. The light curves in 2-4, 4-10, 10-20 keV bands of the scan transit show that the spectrum of the source was hard in the beginning and then softened at the decay part. The time averaged spectrum is fit by blackbody model with kT = 1.8+-0.2 keV. Although we could not find any historical report of X-ray burst from this source, the observed features are consistent with a type-I X-ray burst. The 1s peak flux was 4+-1 photons cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> in 2-20 keV. Assuming the empirical maximum luminosity of X-ray bursts, 3.8 x 10<sup>38</sup> erg s<sup>-1</sup> (Kuulkers et al., 2003, A&A, 399, 663), we estimate the upper limit of the source distance as 9.2+-2.3 kpc.

The red continuum of the spectrum can be attributed to line-of-sight reddening (E(B-V) of about 0.7 mag) . The velocity of the ejecta, as measured from SiII 635.5 nm, is around 10300 km/s. (2) Good matches are found with normal Type Ia SNe / 91T-like about few days before maximum light. From the shallow Si II 635.5 nm absorption an expansion velocity of ~10800 km/s is derived. (3) The redshift of the host galaxy is reported by Grogin et al. 1998 (ApJS 119, via NED, z=0.023356 +/- 0.000053) and it is confirmed from the measurement of the narrow emission superimposed to the broad Halpha feature. A good match is obtained with the Type II Plateau SN 2007od (Inserra et al. 2010, MNRAS 417, 261) two/three weeks after explosion. Along with the prominent Halpha we identify HeI, Hbeta, Hgamma, Fe II, Sc II, and Ca II H&K lines. From the position of the P-Cygni absorption of the Hbeta line, we infer an expansion velocity of ~8400 km/s for the ejected material.

Comparing with similar archive spectra obtained in quiescence at exactly the same orbital phase, the major differences are: (1) a brighter and bluer continuum at shorter wavelengths, with enhanced veiling of the absorption features of the cool giant (in particular the C2 bands at 4740, 5165 Ang, and the CH band at 4303); (2) a large increase in the integrated absolute flux of all emission lines; (3) a large increase in the ionization degree: HeII 4686/Hbeta changing from 1.45 to 2.15, HeII 4686/HeI 5016 from 15 to 28, OVI 6825/HeI 6678 from 1.35 to 2.32. No obvious nebular line is present (in particular [FeVII] and [NeV]). This is consistent with a high density, density-bounded nebula increasingly ionized by a now hotter and more luminous WD. Still, enough neutral hydrogen survives in the system to be able to efficiently Raman scatter OVI 1032, 1036 to observed 6825 and 7088 Ang (the latter 0.38 times the intensity of HeI 7065)."

We have also looked at Swift/XRT images (all taken in PC mode) to search for a possible X-ray counterpart. Stacking all the available Swift observations of this source (taken since the discovery, in early December 2017) provides a total exposure of ~20 ks.

Assuming a power law spectrum with photon index of 2, hydrogen column density of 7.4e20 cm^-2 for this direction (Dickey and Lockman, 1990, ARA&A, 28, 215), and a distance of ~49 kpc (to LMC, e.g., see Pietrzynski et al. 2013, Nature, 495, 76), gives an upper limit of 9.5e33 erg/s on X-ray luminosity.

We obtained a spectrum of this source with the Goodman Spectrograph on the SOAR telescope on 2018 Feb 12.39, covering a wavelength range of about 3800-7800 A at a resolution of 5.8 A. The spectrum shows broad Balmer emission, with an Halpha FWHM of about 3000 km/s and Hbeta FWHM of about 1850 km/s. There are many Fe II lines and strong O I at 7773, which indicate a classification as a nova of the Fe II class. The nova is highly reddened, consistent with its low Galactic latitude of b=-0.06.

The data were reduced with the SALT HRS MIDAS pipeline (Kniazev et al. 2016, MNRAS 459, 3068). The spectrum is dominated by emission lines of H I, Fe II, O I, Na I, Al II, Ca II, Mg I and Mg II (see below a full list of the line identifications). We note the absence of P Cygni absorption in the spectrum. The lines have rounded profiles with a FWHM of around 1700 &plusmn; 100 km/s (for H&#945; and H&#946;). The emission lines and their profiles are characteristic of classical novae of the Fe II spectroscopic class. We can identify the interstellar Na I (D1) and (D2) absorption features.

1036,ATEL #11287,"We report on high-resolution spectroscopy of nova Cir 2018 obtained on 2018 January 29.45, 30.44, and February 2.47 (UTC) using the High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS; Crause et al. 2014, Proc. SPIE, 91476) mounted on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). Observations were taken in the HR mode of HRS, covering a spectral range of 3800-8900 &#8491; at a resolution of R = 65000-67000. The data were reduced with the SALT HRS MIDAS pipeline (Kniazev et al. 2016, MNRAS 459, 3068). The nova has been classified as an Fe II-class nova (ATel #11209), showing emission features of H I and Fe II. The first HRS spectrum obtained was dominated by P Cygni features of H I, Fe II (42, 46, 55, 74), O I, Ca II, Na I, Al II, Mg I, N I, and N II (see below a full list of the line identification), with very faint Balmer emission features. The P Cygni absorption components were at ~ -500 &plusmn; 50 km/s with a FWHM of ~ 300 km/s. The very faint emission features were slightly red shifted (~ +30 km/s) and characterized by a red emission wing extending to more than 500 km/s. Also present are relatively broad Ca II H & K at -500 km/s with a FWHM ~ 1050 km/s. The near-absence of emission lines in the spectrum indicates that, at this stage, the nova is around maximum light. This is consistent with the AAVSO photometric measurements. In the second spectrum the absorption features have weakened, with some having disappeared, while the emission features have strengthened. These emission features, except for the Balmer lines, are now double-peaked, with a main peak at ~ +30 km/s and another at ~ +400 km/s. The third spectrum was dominated by strong emission lines while the P Cygni absorption features have faded considerably. Both the emergence of strong emission lines and the fading of the absorption features indicate that the nova has started the decline from maximum, which is also consistent with photometric data. In addition to the pre-existed lines, more lines also appear in emission such as N II and forbidden O I lines. Besides the Na I (D) blue-shifted absorption features, which are intrinsic to the nova, we can also identify the interstellar Na I (D1) and (D2) absorption features. These lines have EW(D2) = 0.58 &plusmn; 0.01 &#8491; and EW(D1) = 0.46 &plusmn; 0.01 &#8491;.

1038,ATEL #11279,"We report the discovery of the photometric variability of GSC 66-869 in SA 95. Its J2000 coordinates from GSC are: R.A. = 03h 53m 17.72s Decl. = +00° 04' 22.4"", about 3' NW of the variable FASTT89 = SA 95-107 whose periodicity we detected too. GSC 66-869 has V = 13.6 from APASS, and its amplitude from our data is about 0.11 mag. We discovered its variability by means of 2751 unfiltered CCD frames taken in a range of 63 days with the 0.25-m f/10 telescope of OAMH. Differential CCD aperture photometry was performed using Landolt's standard SA95-101 in the same field. GSC 66-869, although having measurements in ASAS-SN, CSS, NSVS and TASS, is not listed as variable in the following catalogs: GCVS, AAVSO-VSX, ASAS-SN, Catalina sky surveys, Linear survey, NSVS, SDSS stripe 82, ASAS, TASS, MOTESS-GNAT, SuperWASP, DIRBE and on many IBVS and OEJV. Our time series shows a smooth intra-night variability with some dips, and a peculiar inter-nights variability with minima (apart from dips) switching state from deeper and sinusoidal to less deep and flat. We have analyzed our time series of GSC 66-869 with the software Period 04, PerSea 2.6 and ATSA (Santangelo et al., 2007, AN 328, 55) using many algorithms. We have found a periodicity P1 = 0.67254 ± 0.00007 d with p-value << 0.001, but our data can be very well phased by the P2 = 2*P1 = 1.34508 d period too. We have found confirmation of the same two alternative periods from our time series analysis of ASAS-SN data. We have not found significant periodicities in CSS data. In NSVS data there could be a marginal detection of a 1-day alias of 1/P1. If the period is P1, there is one dip on the rising branch of our phased light curve of GSC 66-869 and this dip has shape, duration and depth very similar to the transient flux dips in EPIC 205046529B or in RIK 210; according to Stauffer et al. (2017 AJ 153, 152) these dips could be due to orbiting clouds of material. Our alternative hypotheses for the dip are a disk, or rings of debris, or streams, or the transit of a dark body like a brown dwarf. From our data we derived a linear time-shift (about 1.7 minutes/day) of the time of the minimum of the dip. If the period is P1, apart from the dip, the light curve shows the above mentioned switching states of minima, with a slightly longer rise and shorter fall of the light curve resembling some peculiar radial pulsators like V2551 Cyg (Kjurkchieva et al. 2017, RAA 17, 69) or some peculiar HADS or RRc. If the period is P1 with the flat minimum state, then the light curve resembles that of the DSCT V116 in NGC 6791 (Hartman et al. 2005, AJ 130, 2241), but a period of 0.67254 d is too long for a DSCT. If the period is P2, then the light curve strongly resembles that of an EB or EW eclipsing binary with the peculiarities of two dips shifted each other by 0.5 phases and the primary minimum that shows a change in its depth; on the early nights of our observed time span the primary minimum was deeper and sinusoidal, but on subsequent nights it suddenly changed to very flat (constant within 0.01 magnitudes) and with the same depth of the secondary minimum. If the period is P2, then the state with the deep sinusoidal minimum resembles an EB lightcurve, instead the state with the flat minimum resembles an EW lightcurve of an extreme mass ratio binary (EMRB) like V857 Her (Qian et al. 2005, AJ 130, 1206) perhaps with a very small q parameter. A period of 1.34508 d is still border-line for an EW, but it is fully compatible with an EB or RS. From APASS BVg'r'i' and 2MASS JHK we got the observed colour indexes; e.g. (B-V)=0.937. From NED database we got Av = 0.786; so, if the ratio of total to selective extinction is 3.1, then E(B-V) = 0.254; so (B-V)o = 0.683. No spectra of GSC 66-869 are available from SDSS. The spectral class estimated from colour indexes corrected for interstellar extinction is G5 V or G1 III, so it would be compatible with an EB or EW, but not with a DSCT nor a RRc."

PKS 0226-559 continued to be detected on a daily basis on February 7 and 8, 2018, with daily averaged gamma-ray fluxes (E>100 MeV) respectively of (0.3+/-0.1) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 and (0.4+/-0.1) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1. The corresponding photon spectral indexes (E>100 MeV) of 1.8+/-0.2 and 1.9+/-0.2 suggest a rather hard spectral state during the current flaring state. This is the first time that an increasing gamma-ray flux for this source has been announced by the Fermi LAT Collaboration, after almost 9.6 years of Fermi LAT all-sky survey observations. The source was also reported in a flaring state in the optical band on January 22, 2018 by MASTER Net (ATel#11225). Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring of this source will continue. In consideration of the ongoing activity of this source, we encourage multiwavelength observations. For this source the Fermi LAT contact person is S. Ciprini (stefano.ciprini@ssdc.asi.it). The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden."
1043,ATEL #11275,"During the ongoing All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN or ""Assassin""), using data from the quadruple 14-cm ""Leavitt"" telescope in Fort Davis, Texas, we discovered a new transient source, most likely a nova, in the nearby galaxy M31. ASASSN-18ca (AT 2018pp) was discovered in images obtained on UT 2018-02-08.07 at g~16.5 mag. We do not detect (g>18.6) the object in images taken on UT 2018-02-06.12 and before.

1045,ATEL #11277,"IGR J17091-3624 is a recurrent transient source, and a strong black hole candidate. The source has shown many of the same X-ray timing behaviors and ""states"" as GRS 1915+105 (e.g., Altamirano et al. 2011, Court et al. 2017), as well as relativistic disk reflection and strong winds (Reis et al. 2012, Xu et al. 2017; King et al. 2012). However, even close to outburst peak, IGR J17091-3624 is much fainter than GRS 1915+105; its outbursts are difficult to detect in the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory BAT. Based on suggestive recent BAT activity, an XRT exposure was obtained on 2018 Feb 02, starting at 17:49:53 UT. A net exposure of 970s was obtained in ""photon counting"" mode. The source is clearly detected in this exposure: 43 total counts are recorded, with an estimated local background of 4 counts. Assuming an interstellar column density of 8 E+21 cm^-2 and a power-law with an index of Gamma = 2, this corresponds to a flux of approximately 2 E-12 erg/cm2/s (0.3-10 keV). The distance to IGR J17091-3624 is quite uncertain; for a distance of 8.5 kpc, this flux implies a luminosity of L = 3.4 E+34 erg/s; for a distance of 25 kpc (Altamirano et al. 2011), the flux implies a luminosity of L = 3.0 E+35 erg/s. We note that the XRT image is contaminated by mirror rings induced by the nearby bright X-ray source GX 349+2. Source and background regions avoided these rings. Further monitoring may be able to determine whether the source is in a ""hard state"" outburst, or if it is rising toward a full outburst. This source may be of particular appeal for X-ray timing studies. The similarity of its QPO frequencies, power spectra, and flux states to those observed in GRS 1915+105 poses an interesting dilemma: either the two sources have remarkably similar black hole masses and spins, or the observed phenomena and frequencies are set by aspects of the accretion flow but not anchored by gravity.

1046,ATEL #11278,"We performed the spectroscopic observations of SN 2018pv using the 1.5-m Kanata telescope attached with the Hiroshima One-shot Wide-field Polarimeter (HOWPol; Kawabata et al. 2008) on Feb 8.7. This SN was discovered at 15.1 mag on Feb. 3 by the amateur astronomer M. Tsuboi, Hiroshima, Japan. The spectrum resembles with that of a normal Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) at the pre-maximum stage. Using the automatic SN classification tool, GELATO (Harutyunyan et al., 2008, A&A, 488, 383), the spectrum would be similar to that of SN 1992A at the 5 days before maximum. We identified the absorption lines of the CaII IR triplet, OI 7774, SiII 6355, SiII 5972, SII W-shape feature, and Fe II multiplet in our spectrum. The CaII IR triplet, OI 7774, and SiII 6355 line velocities were measured to be ~16500, ~16500, and ~13000 km/s, respectively. The SiII 5972 absorption line was significantly deeper than that of SN 1992A, suggesting that this SN might be a more subluminous event. We measured the equivalent width (EW) of the NaID line as to 0.9 angstrom, suggesting that the host galactic extinction could be very large (A_V~0.5-2.0). Even if the extinction is corrected for, this SN could be still in the rising phase. Follow-up observations could be encouraged."

Based on the spectral comparison tools SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) the classifications were given as: (1) The spectrum of SN 2018pc matches with the normal type Ia supernova SN 2004fz at t = -7 days relative to the maximum light.

Given a redshift of 0.048 (from SNID fit) for its host galaxy, an expansion velocity of about 5500 km/s can be deduced from the Ha absorption minimum; (3) The spectrum of ASASSN-18bt (= SN 2018oh) matches with the normal type Ia supernova SN 2003du at t = -8 days relative to the maximum light.

I could observe the source with the REM Telescope at La Silla on February 7 (MJD 58156.08) in the r,i (Sloan), and J,H (Johnson) filters. Comparison stars were taken from the UCAC4 catalog for the r,i bands and 2MASS for the J,H bands. The following magnitudes were measured: r=16.63+-0.07, i=16.12+-0.10, J=14.68 +-0.07, and H=13.85 +-0.06. The quasar is therefore now about 2 magnitudes brighter than the 2MASS values, J=16.77 and H=16.31.

The position of the burst (RA=245.09, Dec=-50.03; 2 arcmin error radius) on the JEM-X image is consistent with MAXI J1621-501 (ATel #10869, #10874), which has already been recorded as an X-ray burster (ATel #11067). Considering that INTEGRAL cannot distinguish MAXI J1621-501 from AX J1620.1-5002 only separated by about 2 arcminutes, this suggests that the source which is currently seen active by INTEGRAL (ATel #11252) is MAXI J1621-501. The source flux is measured with the following higher values compared to the previous INTEGRAL revolution (ATel #11252): 3-10 keV: 24 &plusmn;1 mCrab, 10-25 keV: 23 &plusmn;5 mCrab, 22-60 keV: 22.5 &plusmn;1.3 mCrab The JEM-X light curves show a structure consistent with a photospheric radius expansion burst reaching the Eddington luminosity.

The total exposure of the <a href="" "">first observation</a> was about 11 ks. The X-ray transients IGR J17329-2731 and GRS 1747-312 were seen to be active by JEM-X.

We find it is faint, with a detection significance of about 3 sigma in the mosaic, i.e., close to the detection limit of JEM-X. We derive fluxes of 5.5 +/- 2.7 mCrab and 11 +/- 5 mCrab in the 3-10 keV and 10-25 keV energy bands, respectively. GRS 1747-312 is a frequently recurring neutron-star binary X-ray transient in the globular cluster Terzan 6 (see, e.g., in 't Zand et al. 2003, A&A 406, 233); we find it at 31 +/- 4 mCrab (3-10 keV) and 14 +/- 9 mCrab (10-25 keV).

1054,ATEL #11274,"Quan-Zhi Ye (Caltech/IPAC) on behalf of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) announces the first detection and follow-up of a Near Earth Asteroid (NEA) detected by the new small NEA detection pipeline of the ZTF/GROWTH projects (developed and running at IPAC). ZTF has recently begun preliminary science observations and includes a dedicated pipeline for detecting small (< 150 meter) trailed NEAs. Once a detection is made and submitted to the Minor Planet Center (MPC), follow-up can be initiated at observatories around the world, including those involved with the GROWTH project. Same night or next night observations are highly advantageous as trailed asteroids have high angular rates, on order of 1""/second or larger, and therefore are only observable for a few days. On the first night of operation (5 Feb 2018) the ZTF fast response small NEA pipeline detected a bright trailed object in 4 r-band images taken over ~2 hours. This yielded 8 endpoint observations of the object, which were submitted to the MPC. Follow-up observations were made by other observatories (MPC circular: MPEC 2018-C23) and the object was designated as 2018 CL by the MPC. 2018 CL was first detected at a distance of about 3 times the Earth-Moon distance and had a closest approach of about 2.4 Earth-Moon distances on Feb 6 4:09 UTC. The NEA had a measured H magnitude of 25.5, and a V magnitude at closest approach of brighter than 15. The size of the asteroid is nominally 50 meters assuming an albedo of 5%. Fifty-six observations of the object were made worldwide in less than 20 hours, providing a well determined orbit. It is a probable Aten asteroid. Low-resolution spectroscopic observations were made the night following the initial detection, 6 Feb 2018, with the robotic Palomar 60” telescope using the SEDM instrument (resolution R~100). We acknowledge the valuable and timely follow-up observations of 2018 CL by astronomers around the world. Additional follow-up observations with higher spectral resolution are encouraged before the asteroid is too far away from the earth. ZTF is a project led by PI S. R.

1055,ATEL #11263,"On 2018 February 4, Swift resumed its daily monitoring campaign of the Galactic center using the X-ray telescope (Degenaar et al. 2015, JHEA 7, 137; see link below). There are currently no active X-ray transients seen within the ~20x20 arcmin region around Sgr A* that is covered by our campaign. The sensitivity limit of a single 1-ks XRT exposure corresponds to a luminosity of ~1E+34 erg/s at a distance of 8 kpc. Before the Galactic center became Sun-constrained, there were two X-ray transients active; the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) GRS 1741-2853 had been active since 2017 October 11 (ATel #10859) and starting on 2017 October 19 we detected activity of a very-faint X-ray transient near Sgr A* that was most likely associated with the neutron star LMXB AX J1745.6-2901 (ATel #10900). Both objects were still detected during the last observation of 2017, performed on November 2. GRS 1741-2853 was still fairly bright on 2017 November 2; a spectrum extracted with the online XRT products tools (Evans et al. 2007, A&A 469, 379; 2009, MNRAS 397, 1177) can be fitted with an absorbed power-law model with an index of 3.7+/-1.5 and a hydrogen column density of (3.4 +/- 1.3)E+23 cm-2 (1-sigma errors, assuming wilm abundances and vern cross-sections for the absorption model tbabs). The resulting unabsorbed 2-10 keV flux is (1.1 +/- 1.0)E-10 erg/cm2/s, which implies a luminosity of ~7E+35 erg/s at 7.2 kpc (Trap et al. 2009, A&A 504, 501). This is over an order of magnitude fainter than earlier on during the outburst, when it was detected at ~1E+37 erg/s (ATel #10859), and may suggest that the outburst was ceasing. The detection on 2017 November 2 implies a minimum outburst duration of 3 weeks, whereas the non-detection on 2018 February 4 limits the maximum length of this outburst of GRS 1741-2853 to 16.5 weeks. AX J1745.6-2901 was detected at a count rate of ~4E-2 c/s during the observation of 2017 November 2, which is too faint to extract a spectrum but implies a similar brightness as the two proceeding weeks, i.e. a luminosity of a few times 1E+35 erg/s at a distance of 8 kpc (ATel #10900). This detection implies that this outburst of AX J1745.6-2901 had a minimum length of 2 weeks. The non-detection in our new 2018 February 4 observation sets a limit on the maximum outburst duration of 15.5 weeks. Our daily Swift X-ray monitoring campaign of the Galactic center will continue throughout 2018. Updates on new observations are immediately posted at the <A HREF= >Swift Sgr A* Monitoring Campaign Website</A>."

The XRT began observing the field about 40 s after the BAT trigger for an exposure time of 1.2 ks.

The source had an averaged count rate of about 0.3 cts/s in the energy band 0.5-10 keV, corresponding to an absorbed flux of 2.3(2)e-11 erg s^-1 cm^-2. We note that the light curve was highly variable and at the end of the observation (about 10 minutes after the trigger) the absorbed 0.5-10 keV flux was approximately 1.2(+0.1)(-0.4)e-11 erg s^-1 cm^-2, substantially higher than in the last Swift observation performed before the event, on 2018 January 28 when it was around 2e-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2. We are monitoring the source since its outburst onset in 2017 May with Swift, Chandra and NuSTAR observations (ATEL #10878). Swift observations are already planned till the end of February, and new simultaneous Chandra and NuSTAR observations will be performed within the next two weeks."

In a combined analysis of the two revolutions, we detect the source at RA = 245.03, Dec = -50.01, 3' error radius, and with an overall detection significance in the 22-60 keV band of 9 sigma. The flux was measured in the 22-60 keV as 1.2 +/- 0.2^-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (11.31 +/- 1.3 mCrab), with an effective exposure time of 23 ks. In revolution 1913 we measure the flux in the 22-60 keV energy band as 1.3 +/- 0.3^-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (12.31 +/- 2.9 mCrab), with an effective exposure time of 4 ks. In revolution 1914 we measure the flux in the 22-60 keV energy band as 1.0 +/- 0.2^-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (9.23 +/- 1.3 mCrab), with an effective exposure time of 18 ks. AX J1620.1-5002 was only in the JEM-X FOV during revolution 1914 and well detected at RA= 245.07, Dec=-50.02, 90% 2' error radius.

We believe this to be the first confirmed detection of AX J1620.1-5002 at hard X-ray energies. We note that in October 2017, MAXI observed a new source, MAXI J1621-501 (ATel #10869). Its measured position is offset by ~12' from AX J1620.1-5002 and the MAXI error circle is ~13'; i.e., consistent with the position of both AX J1620.1-5002 and our detection. The nature of AX J1620.1-5002 is still not known but is a suggested candidate magnetically accreting white dwarf (Degenaar et al. 2012 A&A, 540, 22), but an HMXB nature cannot be completely ruled out (Gemma et al. 2014, ApJSS, 212, 13)."

1067,ATEL #11254,"We report observations of the CO (2-1) rotational line at 230 GHz in comet C/2016 R2 (PANSTARRS) with the Arizona Radio Observatory's Submillimeter Telescope between Jan 9.99-16.23 UT. This object is known to be in outburst since December 2017 (CBET #4464). Mapping of the CO distribution shows that the line emission is detected up to 1' from the nucleus with the signal peaking close to the nucleus position. The beam size of SMT is 32"" at this frequency. The line intensity ranges from 0.34-0.50 K km/s during the observing period, with a line width between 1.0-1.3 km/s and a velocity shift around 1 km/s. A preliminary analysis of the data shows that the CO production rates span from 1.02e29 to 1.44e29 molec/s , assuming a gas kinetic temperature of 30 K.

While the source had a relatively stable luminosity of V=12.84(1) mag during the past days, there was a sudden increase of the observed flux, which started at HJD=2458144.43313 and reached the peak of V=11.85(1) mag at HJD= 2458144.43741 within a few minutes. TYC 4755-59-1 was used as a comparison for the photometric reduction and it was found to be a good standard with V=12.11(1) mag. The observations were obtained in a 3-min cadence and the brightness was increased by 1 mag within 9 minutes with a slope of ~0.11 mag/minute. An exponential decline was observed until the end of the night, when the magnitude dropped from V=11.85(1) mag to V=12.72(1) mag in approximately 45 minutes.

1075,ATEL #11244,"MAXI/GSC nova-alert system (Negoro et al. 2016) detected X-ray brightening from the Be/X-ray binary pulsar GRO J1008-57 on 2018 January 27 (MJD 58145). According to the MAXI/GSC monitor data, the current brightening has started from January 23 (MJD 58141). The onset of this event corresponds to the orbital phase of 0.90, which is derived from the the orbital parameters, T<sub>0</sub>=54416.65 (MJD) and P<sub>orb</sub>=249.48 d (K&uuml;hnel et al. 2013). The 4-10 keV energy flux increased from 0.019 +- 0.06 photons/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (17 +- 5 mCrab) on January 23 (MJD 58141) to 0.045 +- 0.008 photons/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (39 +- 7 mCrab, ) on January 29 (MJD 58147). The average flux increase rate in recent days is ~0.004 photons/s/cm<sup>2</sup>/day. Above results indicate that the present brightening is normal (type-I) outburst. In 2009-2015 season, the MAXI/GSC observations revealed that the onset phase of the normal outbursts distributed in a narrow range (0.92-0.93) in orbital phase. However, the last 4 normal outbursts (Atel#8547,#9512,#10418,#10466) started from the orbital phase of 0.91 (The light curves of the recent 4 outbursts are shown after shifted at the orbital phase 0 in  ). We have confirmed that same trend exists in the Swift/BAT monitor data. This outburst onset shift might imply that the geometrical parameters of the circumstellar disc around the Be star have changed. To investigate the profiles of the Be disc, we encourage multiwavelength observations. The X-ray light-curve can be followed at the following pages: MAXI ( ), Swift/BAT ( ), Fermi/GBM ( ), and the BeXRB monitor page ( )."

The average spectrum, obtained by coadding the five exposures, is well described by an absorbed power-law model with N_H=7.5E20 cm^-2 and photon index Gamma=1.65+/-0.16 (68% c.l.), consistent with the value derived from the broadband spectrum at earlier times (Troja et al. 2018, arXiv:1801.06516). Based on this new analysis, we estimate an unabsorbed X-ray flux of (2.6 +/- 0.3)E-14 erg/cm2/s (68% c.l.) in the 0.3-10 keV band, consistent with the X-ray flux measured at 110 days. <br /> Our results do not support the claim of a decreasing X-ray flux, as suggested by D'Avanzo et al. (2018, arXiv:1801.06164), and are consistent either with a slowly rising afterglow or a slow turn-over of the X-ray light curve expected when the afterglow reaches its peak (e.g. Lazzati et al.2017, arXiv:1712.03237; Troja et al. 2018, arXiv:1801.06516). <br /> We note that the X-ray afterglow displays a marginal level of variability on timescales of a few days, being the count-rate from the last two exposures (20939,20945) consistently lower. The spectrum from these two observations is characterized by a photon index Gamma= 1.9 +/- 0.3 (68% c. l.), slightly softer than the value measured in the first three exposures (20936, 20937, and 20938) Gamma = 1.59+/-0.17 (68% c. l.), yet consistent within the large uncertainties. The lower count-rate and soft spectral shape could be indicative of the cooling frequency entering the X-ray band, although the limited statistics prevent us to draw any firm conclusion."

Preliminary analysis indicates that this source went into a high-flux state starting on 21 January 2018, and continued to brighten over the following days, reaching a peak daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (2.2+/-0.2) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty only) on 23 January. The latter corresponds to a flux increase of a factor of about 28 relative to the average flux reported in the third Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL).

1081,ATEL #11229,"We report on analysis of archival Swift/XRT observations on the supernova impostor SN 2010da AKA NGC 300 ULX-1, which has seen a recent flurry of reports of its rapid spin evolution (e.g. ATEL #11158, ATEL #11174, ATEL #11179, ATEL #11228). A total of 9 Swift/XRT observations of this source have been taken which have sufficient exposure and in which the source was sufficiently bright enough to detect pulsations. These observations were taken between April 25th, 2016 and January 25th, 2018. A 2909s exposure Photon Counting (PC) mode observation taken on April 25th, 2016 is the earliest observation of this source in which we are able to detect a coherent periodicity, and is reported on for the first time here. In order to perform a period search of these data, we corrected the photon arrival times to the solar system barycenter, and randomized the photon arrival times within the ~2.5s PC mode frame time to avoid aliasing issues. Performing a standard Z<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> search of the data, we find a pulsar period of P = 44.18072 +/- 0.00079 s for this epoch. The quoted error is 1-sigma and estimated using the Monte-Carlo method described by Gotthelf et al. (1999, ApJ, 522, L49). With measurements of the pulsar spin period spanning ~640 days, including the XMM-Newton measured value reported by Carpano et al. (ATEL #11158), we find that the spin-up cannot be described by a simple linear model. Therefore, we fit a standard pulsar spin-up model incorporating both first and second derivatives of the spin period. Fitting this model, we find that the global spin-up evolution of NGC 300 ULX-1 can be described by P<sub>dot</sub> = -7.54 +/- 0.07 x 10<sup>-7</sup> s s<sup>-1</sup> and P<sub>dot-dot</sub> = -1.04 +/- 0.03 x 10<sup>-9</sup> s s<sup>-2</sup>. We note that the fit has significant scatter in the residuals, likely due to the unfit contribution of the orbital motion and other effects, however the model well describes the bulk spin-up of the pulsar over a large range of spin periods (20 s to 44.2 s) over a 21 month period. We also note that after removing aliasing effects of PC mode by randomizing the photon arrival times, we do not detect the 30.05s period reported by Grebenev et al. (ATEL #11174) in data taken by Swift/XRT on April 16, 2017, confirming that this was an erroneous detection caused by aliasing of the PC mode frame time, as suggested by Vasilopoulos et al. (ATEL #11179). However, we do detect a periodicity in those data at P = 26.711 +/- 0.002 s, consistent with other reported periods derived from observations taken around that time. Continued observations to constrain both the spin-up and orbital parameters of this system are encouraged."

1084,ATEL #11241,"We report an increase in the X-ray flux from the magnetar 1E 1048.1-5937 in our recent monitoring observation with the X-ray Telescope (XRT) on the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. We measure an absorbed 0.5-10 keV flux of (22+/-2)x10^-12 erg/s/cm^2 on 15 January 2018 (MJD 58133), and confirmed the persistent nature of this increase measuring a flux of (20+/-1)x10^-12 erg/s/cm^2 on subsequent observations on 26-27 January 2018 (MJD 58144-58145) compared to an average flux of (9.2+/-0.5)x10^-12 erg/s/cm^2 in December 2017. As the source is currently in a state of high and varying torque (see Archibald et al. 2015), we cannot at this time place a limit on any change in the timing properties. The 0.5-10 keV pulse profile shows no significant deviation from the quiescent profile, and we detect no significant bursts at a 100-ms timescale in any of these observations. This new outburst epoch has occurred before a full radiative recovery from the last outburst which started in July 2016 (ATEL #9316). Observations at other wavelengths are encouraged."
1085,ATEL #11242,"We have obtained new X-ray observations of GW170817 via Chandra Director's Discretionary Time (PI: Wilkes, Program Number 19408607). The X-ray counterpart to GW170817/GRB170817A/SSS17a continues to be detected and the X-ray emission continues to brighten approximately 156 days after the neutron star merger. This contradicts previous claims of the X-ray fading of GW170817 in XMM-Newton observations at 135 days (D'Avanzo et al. 2018, arXiv: 1801.06164). This new Chandra program acquired several exposures of GRB170817A: ObsID, ExpTime, StartDate, Days Post-Burst ----- ------- --------- --------------- 20936 31.75 ks 2018-01-17 21:55:17 153.5 days 20938 15.86 ks 2018-01-21 13:45:18 157.1 days 20939 22.25 ks 2018-01-24 08:18:48 159.9 days Since these new Chandra exposures are close in time and the X-ray emission of GRB170817A is not expected to vary significantly over <10 day timescales, we co-add these three data sets into one 69.86 ks exposure at 156.4 days post-burst. We perform spectral extractions assuming an absorbed power-law spectral model with fixed NH = 7.5e20 cm^-2 and find that the X-ray flux of GRB170817A has an absorbed flux of f(0.3-8 keV) = 1.93(+0.39/-0.32)e-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2 (with Gamma ~ 1.67) at 156.4 days post-burst, which corresponds to an unabsorbed luminosity of L(0.3-10 keV) = 5.23(+1.30/-0.95)e39 erg s^-1 (assuming a luminosity distance of 42.5 Mpc). This represents continued X-ray brightening compared to Chandra observations at 15.6 and 109.2 days post-burst, for which we find an absorbed flux of f(0.3-8 keV) = 0.36(+0.1/-0.07)e-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2 (with Gamma = 2.4 +/- 0.8, unabsorbed L(0.3-10 keV) = 10.4(+2.0/-1.6)e38 erg s^-1; Haggard et al. 2017) and f(0.3-8 keV) = 1.58(+0.14/-0.13)e-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2 (with Gamma = 1.6 +/- 0.3, unabsorbed L(0.3-10 keV) = 42.5(+3.7/-3.5)e38 erg s^-1; Ruan et al. 2018), respectively. Our findings here contradict recent reports of dimming in the X-ray flux from XMM Newton at 135 days (D'Avanzo et al. 2018), which was reported to be 2.1(+0.7/-0.5)e-15 erg s^-1 cm^-2 (0.3-10 keV unabsorbed). However, this reported flux value is a typo, and should be 2.1(+0.7/-0.5)e-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2 (D'Avanzo 2018, private communication). Taking this corrected flux and rescaling to a 0.3-8 keV absorbed flux for comparison to the previous Chandra measurements above gives 1.67(+0.87/-0.64)e-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2. Thus, the recent X-ray data at 15.6 days (Chandra), 109.2 days (Chandra), 135 days (XMM), and 156.4 days (Chandra) are all consistent with continued X-ray brightening. We provide a light curve table summarizing these measurements: Days, Telescope, Flux* (0.3-8 abs), Ref ---- --------- ---------------- --- 15.6 Chandra 0.36(+0.10/-0.07)e-14 Haggard et al.

For a cocoon, the continued rise of X-ray emission suggest that the cocoon has not yet reached a deceleration phase. For a structured jet, the rising X-ray emission suggest emission from the jet core has not yet entered the observed line of sight. Continued monitoring of GW170817 will be critical for discriminating between these and other models. NB: Another ~30 ks of Chandra observations are forthcoming. We thank Belinda Wilkes and the Chandra scheduling, data processing, and archive teams for making these observations possible."
1086,ATEL #11243,"The Chandra X-ray Observatory re-observed the field of GW170817 starting on January 17th, 2018, and performed five short exposures observations as part of its on-going monitoring program (PI: Wilkes). Only three of these exposures (ObsID: 20936, 20938, 20939) are currently archived and available to the public. Here we report the preliminary findings from these observations. The X-ray afterglow is detected with high significance in all the exposures at an average count rate of 0.0016 cts/s in the 0.5-8.0 keV energy band. A preliminary inspection of the hardness ratio does not show any significant spectral variation. Therefore, we perform a spectral analysis using an absorbed power-law model with absorption column fixed at the Galactic value of 7.5E20 cm^-2 and a photon index Gamma=1.575 as derived from our broadband analysis (Troja et al. 2018, arXiv:1801.06516). We derive an unabsorbed X-ray flux of (3.2 +/- 0.3)E-14 erg/cm2/s in the 0.3-10 keV energy band. The quoted error is at the 68% confidence level. This new measurement is higher than the value measured by Chandra at ~110 days (~2.5E-14 erg/cm2/s, Troja et al. 2018), and higher than the value measured by XMM-Newton at ~135 days (D'Avanzo et al., 2018). The latest measurement is consistent with a rising afterglow with F~t^0.8, although, within the errors, a slow turn-over of the X-ray light curve cannot be excluded. Further analysis is on-going."

The X-ray source position of the star are 16:59:41.64, -40:03:43.7. IRAS 16562-3959 is a bright infrared source with a reported bolometric luminosity of 7*10^4 L_sun.

We extracted the spectrum of the source in the 0.5-10 keV band and found it well-represented by a combination of a thermal (blackbody) and non-thermal (power law) components, absorbed by the interstellar medium. The best-fit gave a power law index of 0.63 +/- 0.08, an absorbing column nH of (6.5 +/- 0.09)e21 cm^-2 and a kT of 0.059 +/- 0.010 keV. From this model fit, we found a flux of (1.02+/-0.3)e-11 erg/cm^2/s in the 0.5-10 keV band.

The observations were taken in the MR mode of HRS, covering a spectral range of 3800-8900 &#8491; at a resolution of R ~ 40000. The nova was discovered on 2018 January 14 .5 (CBET #4472) at V = 7.0. On the same day a low resolution spectrum was obtained confirming the nova classification and showing features of the Fe II spectroscopic class. The SALT data reported here were reduced with the SALT HRS MIDAS pipeline (Kniazev et al. 2016, MNRAS 459, 3068). The SALT HRS spectrum is consistent with the Fe II classification, showing strong permitted lines of H I, Fe II, O I, Ca II, Na I, Mg II, and forbidden lines of O I (see below a full list of the line identification). The lines have rounded profiles accompanied with P Cygni absorption features, characteristic of an optically thick ejecta and typical for Fe II class novae. The Balmer (H&#946; and H&#945;) lines consist of: (1) a main emission, moderately broad, component with a FWHM = 1700 &plusmn; 100 km/s; (2) two absorption components at -750 &plusmn; 50 km/s and -1700 &plusmn; 50 km/s where the higher velocity absorption component is broader; (3) a second blue-emission-component with a FWHM = 320 &plusmn; 30 km/s at around -1100 &plusmn; 50 km/s; (4) a red emission wing extending to more than 2600 km/s.

For a two-day integration, from 2018-01-22 09:50 UT to 2018-01-24 09:50 UT, a maximum likelihood analysis yields a detection at a significance level above 5 sigma, and a flux F = (2.9 +/- 0.9) x 10-6 ph/cm^2/s (E > 100 MeV). The AGILE-GRID detection was obtained while AGILE is observing in spinning mode, surveying a large fraction of the sky each day.

HESS J0632+057 (VER J0633+057 in the VERITAS catalog) is associated with the B0pe star MWC 148 and the X-ray source XMMU J063259.3+054801, and has also been weakly detected at GeV energies. The binary orbital period is 315 days, and the nature of the compact object is unknown. Correlated X-ray and TeV flares have been observed in the past, usually peaking around orbital phase 0.35. The system is currently at phase 0.42. Observations made with VERITAS on MJDs 58136 and 58141 detect the source with a statistical significance in excess of 10 standard deviations in an exposure of 4.3 hours. The integral gamma-ray flux is 5.9e-12 &plusmn 7.7e-13 photons cm^-2 s^-1 above 350 GeV (corresponding to about 6% of the flux of the Crab Nebula above the same energy), about twice the flux typically measured in this orbital phase range.

No radio emission was detected at the reported location, to a 3-sigma upper limit of 10 milliJy/beam (5.5 GHz) and 3.6 milliJy/beam (9.0 GHz). These somewhat large upper limits are due to the limited uv-coverage, plus the close proximity of the SN (10"") to the core emission from NGC 3256 (0.2 Jy at 5.5 GHz). Adopting the host galaxy distance of 37.4 Mpc from Tully (1988, Nearby Galaxy Catalog) this implies an upper limit on the 9 GHz luminosity at an age of at least one month of 6E27 erg/s/Hz.

1116,ATEL #11208,"GX 339-4 is a black hole X-ray transient that entered outburst in September 2017 (ATel #10797). During early outburst, observations were carried out by Swift (ATel #10798), ATCA (ATel #10808), SALT (ATel #10820, #10864), NICER (ATel #10824), and NuSTAR (ATel #10825), among others. These observations found the source to be visible in X-rays, optical and radio bands, and also detected both sub-second and large-scale flaring activity. On 1st November 2017, GX 339-4 became Sun constrained with Swift, and could not be observed until 20th January 2018. We have now observed the source again with Swift/XRT. The observation (ObsID: 00032898161) was carried out on 2018-01-20T17:26:57 for a duration of 76s in Window Timing (WT) mode and 925s in Photon Counting (PC) mode. Swift XRT (XRT; Burrows et al. 2005 SSRv 120 165) data products built using the automated pipeline (Evans et al. 2009 MNRAS 397 1177) show that GX 339-4 has declined in flux compared to the previous observations taken late last year. Using a fit with an absorbed power law, the source is found to have an absorbed flux of 3.5 (+/-0.3)e-10 erg/s/cm2 for the 0.3-10 keV band, with photon index (gamma)=1.36(+/-0.16) and N(H)=5.1(+/-1.3)e21/cm2, for the PC mode (w-statistic=368/411). The results for the WT mode spectrum are consistent within the uncertainties, with Gamma=1.47(+/-0.23). The source is still active, though the flux is lower by a factor of ~2-3 as compared to the peak fluxes seen by Swift/XRT in Oct/Nov 2017. The current photon index implies that the source is in the hard state, and the lower flux suggests that it may be in decline. <a href="" "">Swift BAT</a> and <a href="" "">MAXI</a> light curves are consistent with a declining trend. This therefore may have been a failed outburst, not uncommon for this source, unless the soft state was very brief and missed during Sun constraint. There currently exists a valuable opportunity to study the decline as the source visibility improves over the coming weeks and months for ground and space telescopes. To this end, Swift XRT will continue to monitor the source with a 5 day cadence over the coming month, and multiwavelength observations are welcome. We would like to thank the Swift Team for their scheduling of these observations."

Integrating from 2018-01-18 03:50 UT to 2018-01-19 03:50 UT, a maximum likelihood analysis yields a detection at a significance level above 12 sigma, and a flux F = (1.8 +/- 0.3) x 10^-5 ph/cm^2/s (E > 100 MeV). For a 12-hour integration, starting from 2018-01-18 00:00 UT, a preliminary maximum likelihood analysis yields a flux F = (2.2 +/- 0.5) x 10^-5 ph/cm^2/s (E > 100 MeV). This is the highest flux above 100 MeV measured by AGILE since June 2015 (ATel #7631, #7633, Pittori et al. 2018 (submitted to ApJ)), and higher with respect to the recent detections reported by Fermi-LAT in ATel #11189 and by AGILE in ATel #11115.

The spectral data were obtained on 2018 Jan. 17.746 UT using the Russian BTA telescope equipped with the SCORPIO spectrograph. The spectrum was taken with a resolution of 5.3 Å in the 4050 - 5810 Å range. The photometry of the nova was obtained just before the time of the BTA spectrum with the same device gave B = 18.48 &plusmn; 0.06, V = 18.14 &plusmn; 0.03, Rc = 17.81 &plusmn; 0.05.

The blue edge in the absorption components reach to 1870 &plusmn; 50 km/s. The hydrogen H-beta line has a width of FWHM = 1060 &plusmn; 40 km/s, the H-gamma and H-delta have FWHM = 1150 &plusmn; 50 km/s. Three Fe II lines have FWHM = 980 &plusmn; 100 km/s.

This observation was performed within the frame of a guidance project about astrophysics involving high school students from the Liceo ""Tito Sarrocchi"" (Siena) and Liceo ""Carlo Cattaneo"" (Follonica). Observation of this target was triggered by the recent alerts issued by the Fermi/LAT collaboration (ATel #11189) and by the REM telescope (ATel #11190) reporting a flaring state of the source both in gamma rays and in optical-NIR. Observation consists of 4 x 300 s exposures in the Johnson-Cousins R filter, taken in 2x2 binning under good observing conditions with clear sky and seeing 4.8"" (FWHM), starting at JD=2458136.6377 (civil date 2018-01-18 h. 3:18 UT). The source altitude was about 39 degrees during the observation. After dark current subtraction and flat field correction images were averaged and preliminary photometric analysis was performed by means of the MaximDL software package. Reference and check stars in the field of view were taken from the finding chart made available by Landessternwarte Koenigstuhl at   . The reference R magnitudes for these stars are taken from Villata et al., A&AS 130, 305 (1998).

Measurement comes from a preliminary photometric analysis and may be subject to later refinement. This magnitude is compatible with the R-band measurement provided on January 17 by the REM telescope (ATel #11190). We can also compare this measurement with two previous measurements taken within our blazar monitoring program on January 3 and January 12: <STRONG>Date UT JD mag_R dmag_R Notes 2018-01-03 3:14 2458121.6349 15.38 0.04 strong moon, poor sky 2018-01-13 4:05 2458131.6705 14.70 0.02 2018-01-18 3:29 2458136.6452 13.87 0.02</STRONG> These values are compatible with the recent onset of an increasing trend of the flux at optical wavelengths.

According to the LMC Extinction Retrieval Service (Zaritsky et al. 2004;  ), the weighted mean of the Av values derived in a 5 arcminutes radius for cool, hot and all stars is 0.5+/-0.2 mags. Based on these the following colors are calculated (V-R)0=0.7+/-0.6; (V-I)0=2.9+/-0.3; (V-J)0=4.4+/-0.4; (V-H)0=4.9+/-0.4; (V-Ks)0=5.2+/-0.5. According to the results of Ducati et al. 2001, these colors are not consistent with any main sequence star (too red), but are in a broad agreement with the expected colors for a M spectral type giant or supergiant. This is also consistent with the shape of the SED in the Spitzer and WISE passbands. Such a conclusion is contradicting the reported relatively large proper motion of the object. A chance superposition of two objects on the sky, one of them nearby with a large proper motion is a possible explanation. Further observations and analysis of this potentially interesting object are strongly encouraged."
1124,ATEL #11198,"At 19:20UT on 2018 January 16, Swift/XRT performed a 7-point tiling observation (500s per tile) of the error regions of MAXI J1630-276 as provided by Negoro et al. (ATEL #11173). MAXI J1630-276 is a soft X-ray transient first detected on 2017 November 17 by MAXI (Negoro et al., ATEL #10984). We detect no point sources inside any of the XRT pointings. The XRT observations completely cover the error regions in ATEL #11173, including additional systematic errors. ROSAT source 1RXS J163200.2-273335, is inside the observed region covered by the XRT pointings, but is not detected. 1RXS J163035.5-275500 is outside of the field of view. Neither ROSAT source is consistent with the updated MAXI error regions. We therefore conclude that MAXI J1630-276 has likely turned off. Based on the low background level, and non-detection of any sources, we place a 90% confidence upper limit on the brightness of MAXI J1630-276 of ~10<sup>-2</sup> XRT count/s, assuming the spectral parameters given in ATEL #11173, this equates to a flux of 8 x 10<sup>-13</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (0.5 - 10 keV). We note that this level is not consistent (~2 orders of magnitude lower) than the expected flux as extrapolated from the MAXI measured decay rate between 2017 December 6 and 2017 December 24 (ATEL #11173). This suggests that the source may have turned off rapidly, for example as a result of the propeller effect."

The line profile and velocities are typical of the post-maximum stage of expansion, its brightness suggests this classical nova may also be detected at high energy, especially with Fermi. The nova is clearly still in its declining optically thick stage, the low resolution spectrum from Jan. 14 reported by Kaufman (AAVSO Alert 609) shows Balmer emission lines of comparable with to that described here.

The source was observed by FACT for a total of 5.5 hours between 1:15 UTC and 7:05 UTC (MJD 58135). At the beginning of the observation, the source showed a flux of about 6-7 times that of the Crab Nebula (CU) at TeV energies, then increasing to more than 9 CU. Over the whole observation, the flux was varying between 3 and 10 CU with a decrease towards the end of the night and an average flux of roughly 6 CU.   shows the nightly-binned background subtraced light curve since then and   the 20-min-binned light curve of last night (MJD 58135).

Near-IR spectrum was taken on 2017-12-11 with IRTF telescope in Hawaii, in Prism and SXD mode. The spectrum is rather featureless and shows marginal Halpha in emission at z=1.446. A low resolution optical spectrum was also taken on 2017-12-19 with Asiago 1.82m Copernico Telescope with AFOSC instrument (range 340-820 nm; resolution 1.4 nm), showed a featureless continuum in rest-frame ultraviolet. The new spectrum was compared to the archival SDSS spectrum from 2014-03-06, which showed broad emission lines of MgII, CIII and CIV. These lines disappeared in the new spectrum because of a significant increase of synchrotron continuum most likely connected with jet ejection. The behavior of this blazar is consistent with the anti-correlation between jet continuum and lines EW as shown for 3C345 in Berton et al. 2017, but in a more extreme fashion.

1134,ATEL #11189,"The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, has observed an intense gamma-ray flare from a source positionally consistent with the flat spectrum radio quasar 3C 279, also known as 3FGL J1256.1-0547 (Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23), with radio coordinates R.A.: 12h56m11.1665s, Dec: -05d47m21.523s (J2000.0; Johnston et al. 1995, AJ, 110, 880). This blazar has a redshift of z=0.5362 (Marziani et al. 1996, ApJS, 104, 37). It is one of only seven FSRQs known to be VHE gamma-ray emitters. Preliminary analysis indicates that the source flux has been increasing in the past few days reaching a high state on January 15 with an average gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (8.4+/-0.5) x 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1, a factor of almost 20 greater than the average value reported in the 3FGL. In particular during 18:00-24:00 UTC the average flux was (11.6+/-1.5) x 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty only). The corresponding average gamma-ray spectrum had a photon index (E>100 MeV) of 2.2+/-0.1. This flare represents the highest daily gamma-ray flux detected by the LAT from this blazar since the flare during June 2015 (ATel #7633). This source is one of the ""LAT Monitored Sources"" and consequently a preliminary estimation of the daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi LAT is publicly available ( ). Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring of this source will continue. In consideration of the ongoing activity of this source, we encourage multiwavelength observations. For this source the Fermi LAT contact people are Greg Madejski (madejski@slac.stanford.edu) and Masaaki Hayashida (masaaki.hayashida@hepburn.s.chiba-u.ac.jp). The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.

Observations were carried out with REM on 2018 January 17 between 06:32 UT and 06:50 UT, obtaining three 300 s integration images in the optical g', r', i' bands, and fourteen 15 s integration images in the NIR J, H, and K bands. We obtained for the target the following optical and NIR magnitudes: V = 14.39+/-0.05, R = 13.96+/-0.14, I = 13.37+/-0.08 J = 12.10+/-0.02, H = 11.27+/-0.04, K = 10.27+/-0.04 The NIR magnitudes were calibrated against the 2MASS catalog; optical calibration was performed against the APASS catalog. According to our photometry, 3C 279 shows a brightening of about 1 mag in NIR and 0.6-0.8 mag in optical with respect to the mean values observed by REM during 2005-2012 (see Sandrinelli, et al. 2016, ApJ, 151, 54), in agreement with the increase of gamma-ray activity observed by Fermi-LAT.

The source ASASSN-V J054601.74-665924.2 (position from Gaia, g~13.3) was first observed by ASAS-SN on UT 2014-04-29. To date, ASASSN-V J054601.74-665924.2 has more than ~1300 V-band data points and ~180 g-band data points. The <a href= > ASAS-SN light curve </a> for ASASSN-V J054601.74-665924.2 clearly shows that this is a detached eclipsing binary with a period P_ecl=313.4364 days (g-band: red points, V-band: blue points). The ASAS-SN light curve shows that the V-band and g-band data agree well (g-V ~0), suggesting that this is an eclipsing binary system composed of two massive stars. The eclipses show some asymmetry, with some similarity to the long period LMC binary OGLE-LMC-ECL-11893 (Dong et al. 2014). When the eclipses are removed from the light curve, we find that this source also shows lower-amplitude intrinsic variability with a period P_intr~15.7 days.

The source was close to the sun, but it will be soon observable with Swift/XRT. Using MAXI/GSC 4-10 keV data of 32 scan transits from 11:42 UT on 2017 November 17 to 11:35 on November 19, we obtained the source position at (R.A., Dec) = (247.563 deg, -27.547 deg) = (16 30 15, -27 32 49) (J2000) with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short radii of 0.16 deg and 0.14 deg, respectively. The roll angle of long axis from the north direction is 0.0 deg counterclockwise. We also obtained the source position using 2-4 keV data at (R.A., Dec) = (247.860 deg, -27.406 deg) = (16 31 26, -27 24 21) (J2000) with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short radii of 0.26 deg and 0.17 deg, respectively. The roll angle of long axis from the north direction is 11.0 deg counterclockwise. There is an additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment radius) in both cases. These error regions are hardly overlapped, but consistent with the previously reported position (ATel #10984). After an unobservable period from November 23 (MJD 58080) to December 6 (MJD 58093) to avoid solar X-rays, the 2-10 keV count rate obtained with the image fitting method (Morii et al. 2016, PASJ, 68S, a11) was 0.035(+0.009, -0.008) counts/s/cm2 (~16 mCrab) on December 7, and then decreased exponentially with a time constant of 16.9 +/- 3.3 days. From December 24 (MJD 58111), the source flux was below the detection limit of GSC. A significant spectral change has not been recognized during the outburst. An averaged GSC spectrum obtained from November 16 to December 24 was described by an absorbed power-law with a photon index of 2.0 +/- 0.3 and a hydrogen column density nH of (2.8+/-1.5)E22 atoms/cm2 (reduced chi-square: 0.63), or with an absorbed blackbody with a temperature of kT = 1.5 +/- 0.2 keV and nH of < 8.2E21 atoms/cm2 at the 90% confidence level for this nH (reduced chi-square: 0.76). Note that the total Galactic nH to the direction is 1.5E21 atoms/cm2 ( ).

Using SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024), we find a good match to several Type Ia SNe 10-15 days before maximum brightness. We note that the small number of SNe Ia observed at very early phases often results in a bias to later phases. The SN was discovered at 16.5 mag, which assuming a distance modulus of 31.1 mag for the host galaxy NGC 2525 (Tully et al., 2013, AJ, 146, 86T), corresponds to an absolute magnitude of -14.8 -- or at least 4 mag below peak brightness. This further indicates that the SN is particularly young. If the SN has minimal host reddening, it will peak at V ~ 12 mag. We measure an Si II 6355 velocity of -16,800 km/s. Similarly, we measure a C II 6580 velocity of -15,300 km/s. We detect narrow Ca H&K absorption at the host-galaxy redshift, but do not detect narrow Na D."

1146,ATEL #11179,"Following the discovery of the newly discovered ULX pulsar in NGC 300 (ATel #11158) we searched the available X-ray data for the evolution of the spin period of the neutron star and the X-ray luminosity. Swift/XRT monitored the system between April and July 2017. The system's luminosity was found to be approximately constant at 2-4&times;10<SUP>39</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, consistent with those reported for the XMM-Newton observations (ATel#11158). We performed barycentric corrections to the event arrival times and searched for periodic signals. The signal with the highest significance was found from the observation performed on April 22, 2017 (obsid: 00049834010) and we infer a spin period of 26.65&plusmn;0.1 s. Considering the initial spin period reported for the system (31.6 s; ATel#11158) we derive an average spin-up rate -4.6&times;10<SUP>-7</SUP> s over 123 days. The analysis of the latest Swift observation (performed on July 12, 2017) yields a low-significance signal at 24.36 s. The long-term spin period evolution is consistent with an exponential decrease, which implies that P/Pdot is roughly constant as expected during a phase with steady accretion rate. If that trend continued the current spin period of the system would be expected around 20 s. A new Swift/XRT observation of the system has been approved, that will help us verify this prediction. We note that the spin period detection reported in ATel#11174, is probably a multiple of the Swift/XRT frame time in PC mode, and thus an instrumental feature. We thank the Swift team for accepting and scheduling the target of opportunity observations."

We were already monitoring this source in the NIR and found it with an enhanced flux in the J, H and Ks bands. The source shows an increasing, monotonic trend since MJD 2457997. Furthermore, we detected a very large NIR flare of this source. On January 5th,2018 MJD(2458123.6551), we found the source with NIR fluxes corresponding to J = 11.084 +/- 0.03, H = 10.189 +/- 0.03 and Ks = 9.081 +/- 0.05. While, on MJD 2458100.61 the fluxes in the NIR bands corresponded to J = 12.370 =/- 0.07, H = 11.463 +/- 0.05 and K = 10.560 +/- 0.07. Hence, the source has increased its flux by a factor of 4 in the K band in this this rather short lapse. The source is brightest since the time we started monitoring it on MJD 2454623.9. Our observations are carried out with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo Haro Observatory operated by the National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (Mexico), equipped with the instrument CANICA a NIR camera.

Even if the spectrum of SN2018bi is noisy (due to bad seeing/sky condition), a fairly good match is obtained with Type Ia SNe, few days before maximum light. A significant line-of-sight reddening is suggested by the presence of narrow absorption features that should be attributed to NaI D and also by the red continuum of the spectrum. The velocity of the ejecta, as measured from SiII 635.5 nm, is about 9800 km/s. (3) The spectrum is characterized by a strong blue continuum. There is a weak Halpha emission surrounded by broad absorption troughs. The emission core in Hbeta and Hgamma absorption is only perceptible, while higher Balmer lines are in pure absorption.

1163,ATEL #11161,"We obtained an optical spectrum (range 375-830 nm) of SN 2018dx(=ASASSN-18aj), discovered by All Sky Automated Survey for Supernova(ASAS-SN), on UT 11.8 2018 with the 2.16-m telescope (+BFOSC) at Xinglong Station of National Astronomical Observatories of China (NAOC). The spectrum is consistent with that of a type Ia supernova a few days before the maximum light. Cross-correlation with a library of supernova spectra using the ""Supernova Identification"" code (SNID; Blondin and Tonry 2007, Ap.J., 666, 1024) shows that it matches with SN 2003du at t = -5.0 day from the maximum light. After correcting for a redshift of 0.06(+/-0.005) for its host galaxy SDSS J091612.25+390341.8, an expansion velocity from 10700 km/s to 13800 km/s can be derived from the absorption minimum of Si II 635.5 nm line.

1164,ATEL #11152,"We report optical spectroscopic observations of the supernova (SN) candidate <a href="" "">2017jmk</a> located in the NGC 7541. Two optical spectra were obtained on UT 2018-01-05.1 and UT 2018-01-06.6 with the MDM 2.4m telescope (+ OSMOS; spectral range 398-686 nm) at KPNO and the 2.4m telescope (LJT + YFOSC) located in Lijiang, China, respectively. The OSMOS spectrum exhibits a broad and weak P-Cygni H_alpha profile. The estimated H_alpha expansion velocity is ~4700 km/s, which is relatively low for a normal type II SN at a relatively young age (as indicated from the SN imaging data obtained from the recent, pre-discovery HST observations; see #Atel 11119). The peak of H_alpha is slightly blueshifted (by ~1000 km/s) from the rest velocity, which is commonly seen in relatively young SNe II. We also identify host H, N, and S emission lines along with narrow Na I D lines at z = 0.0095, which is consistent with the redshift of the host galaxy NGC 7541 at z = 0.0090 via NED. The Na I D lines are partially resolved, and the corresponding D1 and D2 lines have equivalent widths of approximately 0.12 nm and 0.10 nm, indicative of significant host-galaxy dust extinction. We perform multi-band imaging follow-ups from the SAO 1-m Zeiss reflector with the CCD photometer based on EEV CCD42-40 chip, the 24-in telescope at Post Observatory as well as Swift UVOT.

Delgado, D. Harrison, S. Hodgkin, M. van Leeuwen, G. Rixon, A. Yoldas (University of Cambridge), on behalf of Gaia Alerts team at magnitude G = 16.48. On GAIA images from 2017-12-20 the object was fainter than limiting magnitude G = 21.5. So the object became brighter on more than 5 magnitudes. We detected Gaia18aak (<a href=' '>Fig.1</a>) on the images taken on 2018-01-09 (MJD 58127.85). Using the AAVSO catalogue for photometric calibration we obtained the following magnitudes of the source (not corrected for the Galactic foreground extinction): V = 17.10 &plusmn; 0.07, R = 17.23 &plusmn; 0.09, I = 17.47 &plusmn; 0.26. On light curve obtained over 3 hours in R-band we detected variations with the period of about 0.068<sup>d</sup> and amplitude 0.15<sup>m</sup> (<a href=' '>Fig.2</a>). Taking into account all these data we can suggest that this object may be a cataclysmic variable - SU UMa type dwarf nova during superoutburst. Further observations are encouraged to confirm the object classification and update the period. </br> We acknowledge ESA Gaia, DPAC and the Photometric Science Alerts Team ( )."
1168,ATEL #11143,"Transient, Tidal Disruption Event The optical transient OGLE17jei = SN 2017jei was detected on 2017-11-15 in a face-on galaxy MRSS 054-118874. OGLE-IV deep stack image shows the host galaxy has an extended central feature (bulge or/and bar) and the position of the transient coincides with S-E part of this structure. It could not be ruled out that the transient is associated with the central black hole. The OGLE-IV photometry suggests the transient was slowly rising from below the detection limit around I=21.5 for the past 60 days (latest non-detection on 2017-11-11), about a week ago it suddenly increased its rate of brightening reaching a peak at I=17.1 on 2018-01-06. Spectroscopic observations with the NTT (ePESSTO, ATel #11114) were inconclusive suggesting this may be a Type IIn SN, TDE or an AGN flare at z=0.058. Swift observed OGLE17jei for 1.0ks on 2018-01-07. Swift/XRT detected no X-ray source at the position of the transient with an upper limit of 0.005 +/-0.002 cts/s. Assuming power law emission with the photon index of 2 and HI column density of 4.16x10^20 cm^-2 this translates to the unabsorbed 0.3-10 keV flux limit of 2x10^-13 ergs/cm^2/s. An ultraviolet source is detected at the position of the transient with the following UVOT magnitudes (Vega system): Band Mag. Err. UVW2 16.78 0.06 UVM2 16.55 0.09 UVW1 16.49 0.07 U 16.52 0.07 B 17.57 0.09 V 17.39 0.14 We also use the UVOT images to measure the position of OGLE17jei: 03:14:11.94 -71:12:25.5 +/-0.1"" J2000 which is 1.1"" from the reported position of the host galaxy. Taking into account the Galactic reddening of E(B-V)=0.033 (Schlafly et al. 2011 ApJ, 737, 103) the ultraviolet magnitudes correspond to the color temperature of about 14000 K, consistent with OGLE17jei being a peculiar Type IIn supernova.

1176,ATEL #11141,"The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, has observed gamma-ray emission from a source positionally consistent with the radio source PKS 2247-131, with coordinates RA=342.4983854 deg, Dec=-12.8546736 deg (J2000; Beasley et al. 2002, ApJS, 141, 13), and no measured redshift. This source is not in any published gamma-ray catalog, but the Fermi-LAT Collaboration already reported gamma-ray flaring activity from this object in ATels #9285 and #9620. Given the localization errors of the LAT gamma-ray source, the blazar PKS 2247-131 is the most credible counterpart. The Fermi-LAT significantly detected this object for the first time in July 2016, and since then the source has shown several periods of increased activity, as can be seen in the public Fermi-LAT light curves ( ). The highest flux since the October 2016 outburst was observed on December 11, 2016, with a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (4.2+/-0.3) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 and a single power-law photon index of 2.29+/-0.07 (statistical uncertainty only). The source has been consistently detected in the daily LAT data since then, most recently on January 3 with a daily flux of (2.3+/-0.3) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 and a single power-law photon index of 2.1+/-0.1 (statistical uncertainty only). Recently, in ATel #11043 and ATel #11127, the AGILE Collaboration announced the detection of significant gamma-ray emission from AGL J2251-1239, whose sky position is consistent with the Fermi-LAT source reported here. The gamma-ray position uncertainties and the estimated flux reported by the AGILE Collaboration suggest that AGL J2251-1239 is the same object detected by the LAT, which is associated with PKS 2247-131. Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring of this source will continue. The Fermi-LAT contact person for this source is S. Buson (sara.buson at gmail.com). The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.

(1991, ApJ 374, 344) we found a 3 sigma upper limit in the 0.3-10 keV band with the Swift XRT of 8.7e-3 counts/s which is equivalent to an observed flux in the 0.3-10 keV band of about 4.5e-16 W m^-2. We did not detect the source in the UVOT and found the following 3 sigma upper limits (exposure times given in s) in the Vega system: V>18.04 mag (63 s), B>19.22 mag (63s), U>18.88 mag (63s), W1>19.23 mag (126 s), M2>19.44 mag (178s), W2>19.98 mag (256s). The Galactic reddening in the direction of GAIA 17dev is E(B-V) = 0.020 (Schafly & Finkbeiner 2011, ApJ 737, 103). GAIA 17dez (3FGL J1159.2-2141) was observed by Swift on 2017 December 26 for 759s. The source is clearly detectd in the 0.3-10 keV band at a level of (9.1+4.0-3.7)e-3 counts/s in the Swift XRT which is equivalent to an absorbed flux of (4.5+2.0-1.8)e-16 W m^-2. In the UVOT we found the following magnitudes in the Vega system: V=17.96+/-0.36 (63s), B=18.12+/-0.15 (63), U=17.87+/-0.17 (63s), W1=17.53+/-0.13 (125s), M2=17.53+/-0.14 (161s), W2=17.73+/-0.11 (251s).

Due to the already low position of the source in the sky, no other candidate could be observed. This source is reported in the UCAC4 catalog at V=16.95, and in the USNO-B1 at B1=16.92, R1=16.77, B2=16.75 R2=15.99, so it does not seem to be strongly variable.

1188,ATEL #11130,"In ATel #11116 we announced the discovery of the predicted 2017 eruption of the recurrent nova M31N 2008-12a on 2017-12-31.77 UT. We reported the follow-up UV detection with Swift/UVOT in ATel #11121. This is the 10th observed eruption in 10 consecutive years of this unique nova system (cf. ATels #5607, #6527, #7964, #9848). Comprehensive multi-wavelength studies of previous eruptions were published by Darnley et al. (<a href="" "">2014</a>, <a href="" "">2015</a>, <a href="" "">2016</a>) and Henze et al. (<a href="" "">2014</a>, <a href="" "">2015a</a>, <a href="" "">2015b</a>, 2018 subm.). For additional optical photometry and spectroscopy of the ongoing eruption see ATels #11116, #11117, #11118, #11124, #11125, #11126. Here we report the start of the supersoft X-ray source (SSS) phase of M31N 2008-12a. A faint X-ray counterpart was detected in a 5.2-ks Swift observation starting on 2018-01-05.48 UT. We measured the preliminary XRT count rate to be (3.1&plusmn;1.0) &times; 10<SUP>-3</SUP> ct/s (corrected for vignetting, dead time and PSF). No X-ray source was detected in the preceding 1.2-ks Swift observation on 2018-01-04.48 UT with an 3&sigma; upper limit of 6.0 &times; 10<SUP>-3</SUP> ct/s. If we assume an eruption date of 2017-12-31.77 UT (MJD 58118.77), identical to the discovery date (ATel #11116), then the SSS counterpart appeared around day 4.7 after eruption. This preliminary estimate is somewhat earlier than the 5.9&plusmn;0.5 days measured in 2014 (ATel #6558, Henze et al. <a href="" "">2015</a>), the 5.7&plusmn;0.5 days seen in 2015 (ATel #7984, Darnley & Henze et al. <a href="" "">2016</a>), and the 5.8 days observed for the peculiar 2016 eruption (ATel #9872). This might suggest an earlier eruption date, which we are currently working on constraining more accurately. In addition, the nova is still detected as an UV source but its magnitude has declined significantly to uvw2 = 19.3&plusmn;0.1 mag (cf. ATel #11121). Our preliminary magnitudes use the UVOT photometric system (Poole et al. <a href="" "">2008</a>, Breeveld et al. <a href="" "">2011</a>) and have not been corrected for extinction. We wish to thank the Swift Team for the rapid scheduling of the observations, in particular B. Cenko, the duty scientists, and the science planners."
1189,ATEL #11132,"We confirm the optical transient ASAS-SN 17pf as a nova in the Large Magellanic Cloud, based on recent spectroscopy. This nova is located at RA = 5:30:16.77, Dec = -73:16:11.3 (J2000). Its ASAS-SN light curve shows a multi-peaked structure; the initial, brightest peak reached V~11.8 mag on 2017 Dec 7 and a recent re-brightening more than 3 weeks after the initial peak reached V~12.8 mag. We have obtained several spectra, the most recent using the Magellan Telescope and the MAGE spectrograph on 2017 Dec 30. The spectrum shows Balmer emission lines with a complex line structure and a systemic velocity of about 250 km/s, consistent with the LMC. These lines have a FWHM of about 500--650 km/s and wings that extend to about 1600 km/s from rest wavelength. Beyond the Balmer lines, the most prominent emission lines are those of Fe II and O I, implying that it is an Fe II nova. ASAS-SN Sky Patrol:  "
1190,ATEL #11131,"At 05:54:50 UT on 30 Dec 2017, BAT measured a burst in its count rates. Because Swift was slewing at the time, BAT did not produce a corresponding image and trigger on-board. Subsequent ground analysis detected the rate increase and allowed an image reconstruction showing a strong peak. The ground-produced location of this source is RA,Dec = 104.6378, -3.4917 which is RA(J2000) = 6h 58m 33s Dec(J2000) = -3d 29' 30"" with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including systematic uncertainty). The BAT light curve showed a single FRED peak with a duration of ~30 seconds. The peak count rate was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at the time of the trigger. The time-averaged spectrum from T-5.5 to T+17.4 sec is best fit by a simple power-law model. The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is 2.26 +- 0.16. The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.0 +/- 0.6 x 10^-7 erg/cm2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.17 sec in the 15-150 keV band is 1.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec. All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level. A follow-up observation with Swift/XRT has been scheduled to refine the source location, if the source has sufficient residual or quiescent flux to be detected at that time. Because this source lies on the Galactic plane, and has a lightcurve and spectrum consistent with an X-Ray Burst, we believe that this is a previously-unknown Galactic transient, which we name SWIFT J0658.6-0330 ."

There is no obvious source detected on the HST images taken on 2017-12-23 and before, while more careful analysis can be carried out on these images using the precise (relative) astrometry derived from the 2017-12-30 HST detections. These HST data can potentially provide excellent near-explosion and pre-explosion constraints on the probable supernova AT 2017jmk and its progenitor. Applying a distance module of 32.9 derived using SN Ia 1998dh exploded in NGC 7541 (Jha et al. 2007) and A_V = 0.2 (via NED), the absolute magnitude AT 2017jmk at discovery was at about -14.6 mag (apparent magnitude 18.5 mag), suggesting that it is possibly young.
